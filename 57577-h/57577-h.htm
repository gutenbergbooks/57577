<p><span class="smcap">Thrusting</span> his tousled head through the
trap-door, Miles made his third and last inspection
for the night. Fierce yellow light
flooded the glass cage; against the panes,
like restless, irritated snowflakes, a few belated
moths fluttered in vain. The circular
base of the lamp cast downward a shadow
so black as almost to appear a solid supporting
cone. At the edge of this Miles reared
his shoulders higher. Under the blue flannel
shirt their weary movement was that of a
sleepy boy; but his thin, dark face shone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
grave as a man&#8217;s. He sniffed the familiar
smell of oil and hot brass, and glanced perfunctorily;
the lamp burned as bright as it
had three hours ago, at midnight, or as it
would burn three hours hence, at sunrise,&mdash;with
the same provoking virtue that made
his nocturnal rounds a waste of labor and
sleep.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some one has to,&#8221; he said aloud. &#8220;Burn
away, Beast!&#8221; With this customary good-night,
he clattered downstairs, locked the
lighthouse door, caught up his lantern, and
went whistling along the narrow path by the
river. From below, to the left, stole the salt
coolness of seaweed bared at low tide,&mdash;a
sharp aroma that set him wide awake. From
above, over a black phantom hill, peered
Orion&#8217;s red shoulder-star. Hurtling shadows
of undergrowth before his lantern rose magnified,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
parted in rout, wheeled slowly, fell
prostrate and infinitely prolonged. The grass
fringe of his smooth-beaten trail gleamed
with a pearly rime of autumnal dew. &#8220;Nearly
frost to-night,&#8221; thought the boy.</p>

<p>He raced down into a steep gully, drummed
across a little foot-bridge, took by scrambling
assault the other bank, and on the crest, suddenly,
as their black wall yawned to engulf
him, entered a low grove of pines and cedars.
The cold wet bristles bedewed his hands, as
he skipped along, now scuffing loudly on a
worn ledge, now over a stretch of wet touch-wood,
the full, fern-bordered length of a vanished
log, that made him advance silent as a
ghost.</p>

<p>A ghost&mdash;he often thought of that, for now
came the one mild excitement. Three times
every night, his grandfather&#8217;s unofficial deputy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
he tramped this triangular beat, downhill,
along the shore between the two fixed
lights, uphill again to the farmhouse. At
first a lark, this tramp had in the last year
become dull monotony; his score, penciled
in the back of his beloved atlas, showed over
a thousand tours, on which nothing ever happened;
and yet now and then, as he neared
the Admiral&#8217;s deck, he felt the childhood
presentiment that just ahead something would
appear. Usually a nameless emotion, faint
and swiftly obliterated, it came now, in the
early morning darkness, almost as the pristine
thrill.</p>

<p>At the place which had helped to name the
whole shore, his path widened into a clearing
beside a low bluff. The lantern twirled its
shadow-ribs across a floor of rotten wood,&mdash;old
ship&#8217;s planking, the few solid remnants auger-bored.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
Here, beside a stout rail which now
tottered over the dark gulf, Admiral Bissant,
the boy&#8217;s great-uncle, had walked the quarter-deck
in his dotage. Miles&#8217;s grandfather never
mentioned the tradition; but old Fisherman
Bull had often told how, dropping down river
in the Mystic Tie, he had seen an aged figure
pacing the verge above, in faced uniform
and cocked hat. &#8220;Givin&#8217; orders he was,&#8221; said
the fisher, &#8220;to nobody&mdash;trompin&#8217; an&#8217; mumblin&#8217;
amongst the trees, bossin&#8217; hemlocks fer
men.&#8221; To prove the story there remained
uniform, cocked hat, and sword as well, rescued
by Uncle Christopher when the old Bissant
house burned, and now hung in the &#8220;front
hall&#8221; of their cottage. And these mouldering
planks still outlined the landfast quarter-deck.
A ghost there must be, Ella said.
Of course that was her nonsense. Only a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
faint breeze of dawn sighed through the
drooping needles.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing ever happens,&#8221; thought Miles.
He dived into a dark billow of firs, brushed
along with now and then a gossamer damp
across his cheeks, and following the outward
curve of the shore, emerged on a tiny promontory,
down which a ragged wall of Norway
pines sloped to the second lighthouse,&mdash;another
stunted white obelisk tipped with
radiance. Here again his inspection was needless;
and soon he climbed the homeward field,
where fast encroaching fir-trees squatted like
a thinned regiment of dwarfs.</p>

<p>At the farmhouse door he blew out his lantern;
and tiptoeing from the stair-head past
his grandfather&#8217;s room, undressed in the dark,
and was soon abed and asleep.</p>

<p>Full flood of autumn sunshine woke him;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
and from a late breakfast alone, he went, as
usual, straight to the &#8220;library.&#8221; Before a
snapping beech-wood fire, his grandfather,
a tall, spare man, whose ruddy, clean-shaven
face was marked with severe wrinkles, paced
in uncertain fidgets, both hands clasping a
Bible at his back.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get your Testament, sir,&#8221; he commanded
querulously, without turning his hook-nosed
profile. Ella, the &#8220;girl&#8221; who had served their
family these thirty years, looked up and
nodded furtive encouragement, then bent to
as furtive a study of the long words. Sitting
beside her, Miles could see the fat fingers,
white and puckered from hot water, faltering
across the narrow columns, balking beneath
Urbane, Stachys, Tryphena and Tryphosa.
When her turn came to read aloud, she
omitted them one and all, glibly, but with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
air of a nervous knitter dropping stitches.
The old man, standing braced before the
fire, affected not to notice. It was one of his
few compromises. He read on sonorously,
his head uplifted before the portrait of his
brother, the Admiral, who stared down from
the canvas with the same ruddy face and
close white curls, the same beaked severity
and intolerant poise.</p>

<p>Their devotions ended, Ella went bustling
to her kitchen, and the head of the Bissant
family turned to its youngest survivor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-morning, sir! Are you any better
prepared to-day?&#8221; With eyes of a confused,
smoky brightness, he surveyed his grandson,
then searched the few old books on
the shelves. &#8220;Hmm! Sallust&mdash;yes, just so.
Come, begin&mdash;where&#8217;s the lesson, eh?&mdash;No,
not there, either, take it all!&mdash;Hmm!&mdash;Ah,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
here &#8217;tis, boy: <i>Volturcius interrogatus
de itinere</i>&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please, sir,&#8221; said Miles humbly, &#8220;we
don&#8217;t&mdash;it&#8217;s Saturday, grandfather.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Eh, what the devil?&#8221; complained the
old man. &#8220;So &#8217;tis, boy, so &#8217;tis. Always Saturday.&#8221;
Frowning vaguely, he thumped the
book on the table. &#8220;Well, and how d&#8217;ye
propose to waste your time to-day?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shooting, sir, if you don&#8217;t mind,&#8221; ventured
Miles. &#8220;The law&#8217;s off on patri&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t let me hear that barbarism!&#8221; cried
his grandfather bitterly. &#8220;Must we talk like
rustics? If you <i>will</i> miscall the ruffed grouse,
sir, call it p-a-r-t&mdash;partridge! Say it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Partridge, sir,&#8221; mumbled the boy sheepishly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Louder!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Partridge.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>&#8220;Again!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Partridge, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now go,&#8221; commanded his grandfather,
&#8220;and write out that word fifty times, before
Monday&#8217;s lesson!&mdash;Come back here; who
said I&#8217;d finished? Write it with a capital R!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; said Miles, and slipped from
the room. The door closed, and the rebuke
vanished; for there stood the shotgun ready
in the corner, and Ella packing his basket.
As he stepped out into autumn sunshine, he
repaid her with a promise,&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll bring home some good pat&mdash;partridges.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fat ones?&#8221; she jeered, her freckled face
again in the doorway. &#8220;Then you&#8217;ll have to
feed &#8217;em first. A high old hunter are you!
They&#8217;re still in the lowlands a-stuffin&#8217; alder-berries,
thin as Macfarlane&#8217;s geese.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t say fat partridges, Ella,&#8221; he
called back. A shrill protest pursued him:
&#8220;O-o-h, Master Miles, you did, because I
heard you!&#8221;</p>

<p>Behind their house the hillside rose, abrupt,
and slippery with ripe yellow grass.
After a brief climb Miles could look back
over the warped roof and see the convex field
plunge toward the river. Pausing again for
breath, he could see the trunks of the two
tall hackmatacks which stood before the door,
green pillars of an imaginary gate. From
between them two brown paths forked wide,&mdash;sides
of the triangle described by his nightly
tour. Pines and underbrush of solemn evergreen
hid the distant base, but the twin lighthouses
marked each extremity by a fat white
column, low and red-capped. Beyond these,
in the crisp air, the river shone steel-blue,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
streaked with tides, blackened with light
squalls, and throughout the two miles of its
width, empty, except for the dotted penciling
of weirs, and for one dark fir knoll, the
little midway island. Yellow birches, scarlet
maples, flamed like bale-fires along the evergreen
headlands on the other shore; but hay-fields
of the American borderers, over there,
still remained verdant squares, dressed in
the living green of second crops.</p>

<p>He gained the crest, and shifting his gun,
struck across a decrepit orchard toward the
green wall of the woods. Suddenly a white
fleck, through the pattern of gnarled boughs,
stirred in the adjoining field. A horse whinnied.
The boy stopped in astonishment.
What were men and horses doing by the
ruins of the old house? He changed his
course.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>Where the Admiral&#8217;s house, last sign of
family prosperity, had long ago burned to the
ground, the cellar yawned like a grassy crater
in a pasture knoll. Hawthorns, a hedge
grown high and wild, screened the mound on
its river side; and framed in glossy leaves
and scarlet clusters, a little man scrubbed
vigorously the back of a tethered pony. The
beast was curiously piebald, blotched with
snow white and dingy gray.</p>

<p>Miles and the pony stared at each other.
The man, without pausing, turned a swarthy
face, scowled, and then grinned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello, Squair,&#8221; he called slyly, &#8220;don&#8217;t
give a poor chap away now, will ye?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Give what away?&#8221; said Miles, wondering.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pipe-clay,&#8221; replied the stranger. He
dangled a rag aloft, stirred it in a bucket on
the grass, and smeared another snow-white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
patch down the pony&#8217;s flank. &#8220;How&#8217;s that,
huh? Look a-here,&#8221;&mdash;his crafty black eyes
twinkled,&mdash;&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you what, Squair. If
you won&#8217;t give me away, I&#8217;ll let ye finish
the rest of him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miles joyfully vaulted the rails. Horses,
in his life, had been rare. Hardly had he
begun this new, odd, and delectable employment,
before the little man was seated on
the mound of ruin, a luxurious critic.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t rub so hard.&#8221; He stuffed tobacco
into a black pipe. &#8220;Ye ain&#8217;t curryin&#8217;. Coat
her smooth and even.&#8221;</p>

<p>Pleasure gave way, at last, to curiosity.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s it for?&#8221; asked the boy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, now, &#8217;tain&#8217;t my fault,&#8221; rejoined
the stranger candidly. &#8220;But our paterons <i>do</i>
like to see a white horse. No use o&#8217; talkin&#8217;,
they do. Now Terry&#8217;s smart as the Old Sarpint,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
but he ain&#8217;t altogether a thorough white.
Not thorough and complete, he ain&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, he&#8217;s a gray!&#8221; cried Miles, patting
the inquisitive muzzle.</p>

<p>&#8220;I give ye credit for that!&#8221; approved the
man. &#8220;To them that didn&#8217;t know him well,
Terry <i>would</i> seem grayish. I don&#8217;t deny
they&#8217;s mottles, suspicion o&#8217; gray, in places,
as you say.&#8221;</p>

<p>Behind the speaker, a black shape bounced
up out of the ground. A large Newfoundland
dog, leaping from the cellar, raced down the
bank, frisked about Miles with wide-flung
paws, made a kind of salmon leap into the
air, turned an amazing somersault, and, rebounding
from the grass, perched on the
pony&#8217;s back. Next moment he sprang down
again, and with forepaws on the boy&#8217;s shoulders,
barked riotously in his face.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; cried Miles, dazed and deafened.
&#8220;So that&#8217;s it. You keep a show!&#8221;</p>

<p>The little man blew upward a cloud of
smoke in the sunlight, and nodded lazily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Other side the hawthorn,&#8221; he grunted.
&#8220;Go look.&#8221;</p>

<p>Spread to dry across the sheep-sorrel, long
strips of canvas bore inscriptions red and
blue: &#8220;Gypsy Fair,&#8221; &#8220;Abram the Magician,&#8221;
&#8220;Performing Quadrupeds,&#8221; &#8220;Madge the
Egyptian Seeress tells your Future,&#8221;
&#8220;Equine Theatre,&#8221; &#8220;Terry the Horseflesh
Wonder,&#8221; &#8220;Ride the Gypsy Mare.&#8221; The boy
returned with round eyes alight. Here was
the Romany Rye, not in grandfather&#8217;s book,
but in real life.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you&mdash;do you keep a seeress?&#8221; he
cried. &#8220;And a real magician?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come here,&#8221; said the man mysteriously.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong with your nose?&#8221; He tweaked
that organ viciously three times, and produced
in swift succession a whittled square
of black tobacco, a stag-horn knife, a blue
cotton handkerchief. &#8220;Beats all,&#8221; he marveled.
&#8220;Beats me, Squair, why ye ever
stowed those up there! Gettin&#8217; hunchback,
too, ain&#8217;t ye? Bend over.&#8221; Miles felt the
man&#8217;s hand slip beneath his collar, then
something cold between the shoulder-blades.
&#8220;Well, no wonder,&#8221; said the magician.
There in his hand was a bell-mouthed
flageolet, with tarnished German-silver
keys.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you Abram?&#8221; asked the boy, laughing,
but a little daunted.</p>

<p>The other nodded. &#8220;Onhitch Terry. Now
ye watch.&#8221; Putting the flageolet to his lips,
he squealed forth a sprightly air. At the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
first notes the pipe-clayed pony reared on
his little hind-legs, and, keeping rude time,
staggered through a precarious pirouette.</p>

<p>&#8220;He can choose colors, too,&#8221; said his master,
when Terry had dropped to all fours,
&#8220;and add sums, and fire me a pistol, and
play me a toon on bells.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And carry me on his back, standing up,&#8221;
called a treble voice above them. A barefoot
girl with strange light-colored hair, and a
woman in gray calico, stood on the edge of
the grassy crater.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re campin&#8217; in the cellar,&#8221; explained
Abram,&mdash;&#8220;my little girl and my wife; she&#8217;s
Madge the Seeress.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you&mdash;are you,&#8221; faltered Miles, fearing
to give offense&mdash;&#8220;are you&mdash;Egyptians,
please?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A descendant o&#8217; Pharaoh,&#8221; said Abram<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
gravely. &#8220;Born on the banks o&#8217; the Nile.
The Seeress&#8217;ll tell your fortune. Got any
money?&#8221;</p>

<p>Miles grew cautious, remembering dark
tales.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That is, hardly any. One
twenty-cent piece and a lucky penny.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Heard some jingle when ye clumb the
fence,&#8221; objected the wizard.</p>

<p>&#8220;That was cat&mdash;cartridges,&#8221; retorted Miles,
drawing back uneasily.</p>

<p>&#8220;For shame, Abe!&#8221; interposed the woman.
&#8220;For shame! We&#8217;re not in the tent now:
no need lyin&#8217; to innocents like that.&mdash;Come
here, my boy,&#8221; she said kindly.</p>

<p>Miles climbed toward the Seeress, embarrassed
and deeply disappointed. Her neat
calico, her tired, honest face, smooth gray
hair, and friendly eyes were a sore disillusion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
Where were elf-locks and eldritch voice? He
had hoped for Meg Merrilies.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you ever hear tell of a Pharaoh
named Tucker?&#8221; she asked, taking his hand.
&#8220;Me neither, and that&#8217;s my husband&#8217;s name.
And if the Nile ever flowed in Sagadahoc
County, it run dry &#8217;fore my day.&#8221; She
smoothed his open palm. &#8220;No one can tell
fortunes, sonny, but I can tell characters.
This palm&#8217;s an honest palm; so take your
time, go careful, and you&#8217;ll grow to be an
honest man. And a clever palm. There&#8217;s
gentle blood in the veins. That always speaks
out. A good head, but the heart&#8217;ll run away
with it. Master power o&#8217; friendship, few
friends. I guess there&#8217;s danger ahead o&#8217; you,
but else I&#8217;m much mistaken you come o&#8217;
people fond o&#8217; danger. You&#8217;ll do better by
others than yourself&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>&#8220;Are you coming to our show?&#8221; interrupted
the girl. Miles turned shyly. Girls, at Admiral&#8217;s
Light, were rare as horses. And
though of about his own age, this was a
strange little creature. Her luminous brown
eyes seemed at once frank and shy; thoughtfulness
in the tanned oval face was changed,
by a circumflex arch of eyebrows, to a mischievous,
almost elfin gravity; and her hair
reminded him of oak leaves in winter, except
that they were dead and dull, and this color
shone exceedingly alive.</p>

<p>&#8220;Coming to our show?&#8221; she repeated:
&#8220;this afternoon, uptown?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t,&#8221; he stammered. &#8220;We&#8217;re too&mdash;We
don&#8217;t go to many&mdash;many entertainments.&#8221;</p>

<p>Madge the Seeress gave him an odd,
shrewd glance of approval.</p>




<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>&#8220;Never mind,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Most of our
show you&#8217;ve seen already. Would you like
to ride the Gypsy Mare, though?&#8221; The
look on the boy&#8217;s face answered. &#8220;Abe,
let him.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man rose, grumbling, &#8220;A free ride,
when he&#8217;s got twenty cents?&#8221; but nevertheless
disappeared behind the mound, and
returned leading a beautiful sleek white mare,
already saddled. &#8220;No pipe-clay there!&#8221; He
tightened girth and shortened stirrups. &#8220;Up
ye go, Squair!&#8221;</p>

<p>Miles had ridden Hab Belden&#8217;s plough-horse
once or twice, but never a mount like
this. The mare footed among the sorrel,
swift and gentle as the fairy charger that
cantered over eggs. He pulled up reluctantly,
with face glowing.</p>

<p>&#8220;A born trooper,&#8221; said Abram. &#8220;Straight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
back, close seat, flat thigh, soople. Ye rode
her like a gen&#8217;ral! Now would ye believe
me, Squair, if I spoke but the two words,
she&#8217;d throw ye like a rocket. Five dollars
I offer in open tent for the man or boy that
sticks her&mdash;and only two ever done it.
Want to try? Shall I speak to her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; began Miles.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fraid-cat!&#8221; laughed the girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Speak to her,&#8221; he ordered tartly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Throw him, Jubilee!&#8221; cried the conjurer.</p>

<p>Miles felt the white body tremble under
him, as in terror. With a snort and a swoop,
the mare plunged uncontrollably along the
brow of the hill, head down, switching herself
double from side to side, as a fish fights
in a net. Losing his seat, Miles caught it again
by blind miracle, just as she spun dizzily and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
reared in lightning estrapades. Hereditary
instinct, the spirit of the cavalry captain, his
father, served him well. Sick with fear&mdash;not
of a broken neck, but of humiliation before
that girl&mdash;he clung as in a desperate dream.
He felt the back hump like a dromedary&#8217;s,
the close-bunched hoofs pound the earth with
quick, disintegrating jars. Some one shouted.
He ducked. A hawthorn bough furiously
swept his back. The bole of an elm flashed
past, and he was conscious of powdered bark
smeared on a smarting leg. Then they fought
it out, raging mare and raging rider, till
with a balk that nearly shot him over her
neck, Jubilee stopped dead, and, trembling
as when she began, seemed gradually to sink
beneath him. He kicked out of stirrups,
swung over, fell with a crushing pain in one
ankle, and, through an interminable leisure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
in which he tasted sour sorrel, rolled clear
from the flourishing hoofs.</p>

<p>Roaring blasphemy, the showman had
snatched the bridle, and as the white mare
rose, was beating her over the head with a
cudgel.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop that!&#8221; cried Miles, from the ground.</p>

<p>&#8220;Roll, will ye?&#8221; screamed Abram, showering
blows insanely. &#8220;Roll, God nourish ye!
Never learnt that trick o&#8217; me! Roll, ye&mdash;Begin
that once, an&#8217; my theayter&#8217;s ruined!
Roll, ye&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The woman raised Miles to his feet. &#8220;Not
hurt, are you? Poor boy! Much hurt?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. Make him stop that!&#8221; he whimpered.
A white-hot cord tied tighter round
his ankle. He limped forward, but the woman
seized and carried him toward the fence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go home quick!&#8221; she whispered. &#8220;I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
know him. He&#8217;ll come at you or me next,
if you vex him now. Can you walk? Quick,
then, go home.&mdash;Here, Anna, see he gets
back safe.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miles found himself in the orchard, dragging
painfully, easing his weight by the gun.
At each halt the girl eyed him strangely. On
the slope above the house he suddenly lay
down.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rest a minute,&#8221; he explained through
clinched teeth. &#8220;I live down there&mdash;you
needn&#8217;t come.&#8221; The tawny hillside swam.
His foot seemed to shrink and swell, with
alternating torture.</p>

<p>&#8220;A thorn&#8217;s in your cheek,&#8221; said the girl.
&#8220;No, the other side.&#8221; He pulled the sharp
point out mechanically. &#8220;Didn&#8217;t that hurt?
What&#8217;s your name?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Miles Bissant,&#8221; he said indifferently. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
a long stillness sounded the dry, faint click of
grasshoppers, snapping upward in short arcs
roundabout.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mine&#8217;s Anna Hilliard,&#8221; she volunteered;
and after another silence, &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry I said&mdash;that.
Good-by.&#8221;</p>

<p>By her voice, she was crying. Through
half-opening eyes, he saw her hair glimmer.
Something warm touched his cheek.</p>

<p>He sat up, indignant, rubbing the spot with
more energy than if the thorn had stung. A
hard patter of bare feet fled up the path.</p>

<p>&#8220;What a silly girl!&#8221; thought Miles, in
disgust. &#8220;Glad nobody was round.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br />

<small>CAPTAIN FLORIO</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">&#8220;Runagates,&#8221;</span> said his grandfather, with
mournful relish. &#8220;I had hoped you&mdash;but
what&#8217;s in the blood will out. All runagates!&#8221;</p>

<p>Athwart the dim panes of the bedchamber,
hackmatack boughs swayed to the chill drone
of a dying wind. A rigid profile against twilight,
the old man spoke as to some third
presence. Often the boy had seen that profile,
ploughing a furrow of thought which
cast him aside; yet he stirred on his pillows
uneasily, almost guiltily.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/chap2.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>&#8220;So with Christopher,&#8221; continued the
speaker, &#8220;and so with your father Godfrey.
When they strayed off into the world, what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
did they become? A sailor to be drowned
and a soldier to be killed. My sons were small
comfort.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My father,&#8221; objected Miles, timid yet
indignant, &#8220;was fighting for&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what if he was?&#8221; exclaimed his
grandfather, turning with a violent start.
&#8220;Does that excuse you, sir, for scouring the
country with gypsy thieves? Eh? And risking
your neck at horse-jockey tricks? And
lying useless abed this fortnight, while Ella
and I do your work at the lights? Next you&#8217;ll
slip off, like them, and then the contract for
the light-keeping will be taken away, and I&#8217;ll
become a pauper indeed. Runagates! Eh?
What&#8217;s that? What did you mutter?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing, sir,&#8221; said Miles. He understood
now the old man&#8217;s gloom, and lay still,
with long thoughts of pity and contrition.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
The rebuke was just: had he not been lying
here, his head full of day-dreams, plans, vainglorious
romance? He could ride&mdash;he had
proved that; he loved the sea with an inborn
longing. Which, then, was the better life,
soldier&#8217;s or sailor&#8217;s? Dull peace at home, he
had thought, was not to be endured. The
brief spice of action, of danger, had so edged
his fancy that the whole fortnight had passed
among conjured shapes of adventure: brigantines
navigated through seas not in the
atlas, coral islands raised against the dawn,
typhoons weathered, cannibals beaten off&mdash;were
these better than a red whirl of cavalry,
with trumpets, with sabres, with leather
creaking like Jubilee&#8217;s saddle? The choice
had seemed, at times, easy and immediate.
And now grandfather had somehow scolded
him to his senses. He could not put the new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
emotion into words, but in a flash he had seen
that this pictured joy of living was the mere
pride of life.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong?&#8221; grumbled the old man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ankle twinged. Nothing,&#8221; replied Miles.
He could not explain what brightness had
died out.&mdash;Ella&#8217;s step mounted toward them,
and the shadow spokes of banisters wheeled
in a striped flange across the ceiling, before
he spoke again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about all that, grandfather.&#8221;</p>

<p>The advice, the audacity, surprised them
both; neither was aware that between boyhood
and youth a door had closed forever.</p>

<p>Closed it had, nevertheless, and Miles,
when afoot once more and outdoors, wondered
vaguely at the change in his little world.
Frost-bitten fields, white-caps on the border
river, birch groves and maple shifting their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
bleak reticulation against a sky that threatened
snow,&mdash;these formed a background
for new and sober thoughts. He had lost the
conviction that his future must be different,
transplanted and transformed, bright with
surprise, excitement, and good fortune. All
that was nonsense. Here lay his life, studying
by day, trudging by night down to the twin
lamps; for variety, he wore now his threadbare
reefer, now his mittens and great helmet
of moth-eaten fur; now plodded on snowshoes
over drifts, where powdered gold puffed
upward, at each step, into the lantern-light;
now cleared the tower windows of damp
snowflakes; now waded in hip-boots through
pools of freshet. One deeply starred spring
night, he surprised himself recalling that the
girl&#8217;s name was different from Abram&#8217;s.
&#8220;Perhaps she was adopted,&#8221; he thought, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
he sniffed the damp sweetness of reviving
earth, &#8220;or an orphan, like me.&#8221; On the heels
of this, he could excuse her folly: &#8220;I was
hurt, of course, and she felt sorry that she&#8217;d
stumped me. Perhaps Abram would beat
her, too&mdash;&#8221; Why should he speculate, so
long afterward, about persons whom he would
never see again?</p>

<p>The next years saw him grow into a young
man, silent, grave, with a tranquillity that a
stranger might have mistaken for contentment.
On one point, indeed, he was contented:
his grandfather, who had rebuked
his father&#8217;s memory, could find no major
fault with the second generation.</p>

<p>One June evening he lay stretched on the
mouldered planks of the Admiral&#8217;s deck, a
book of next day&#8217;s lessons opened flat before
him. A sunset swarm of midges, down-sifted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
by a breath of air, suddenly confused Euclid&#8217;s
lines and dots with a dance of jigging motes.
Miles swept an impatient hand, glanced off
the page, and forgot both insects and trapezoids.
A boat was making straight toward
him,&mdash;a green &#8220;lap-streak&#8221; dinghy, rowed
by some Yankee from across the river, and
carrying on the stern thwart a jaunty passenger
in light gray. No sooner had the boat
nosed the undulating fringe of seaweed than
the stranger sprang nimbly to the rocks, and
scrambled over their slippery, tangled hummocks,
in a diagonal course up the beach.
He disappeared under a shoulder of the bank,
and, as Miles still lay wondering, suddenly
emerged from the firs beside the old quarter-deck.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; he said, with an odd, pleasant
intonation. &#8220;May I come in? Jolly little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
nook for reading, haven&#8217;t you? No, don&#8217;t
get up. Just tell me how to strike the path
to the house, above there, will you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Except the tender&#8217;s gig, no boat ever
touched at Admiral&#8217;s Light. No such visitor,
certainly, had landed within Miles&#8217;s recollection.
Burly but active, with the body of a
blacksmith or pugilist clad in pale gray flannels
of a knowing, worldly cut, he seemed
at once young and mature, sophisticated and
breezily adventurous. The same hand which
held two primly folded gloves bore on its
back a foul anchor tattooed in blue. Bright
gray eyes in a swarthy face, clean cutwater
profile, reckless good-humor playing about
the lips, bespoke one who had taken a man&#8217;s
share of life with a boy&#8217;s share of amusement.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know the old gentleman that lives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
up there?&#8221; he continued. &#8220;Your grandfather,
eh? Well, now, perhaps you can tell
me. Had he a relative named Christopher?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That was my uncle,&#8221; said Miles, getting
to his feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;The dickens! You!&#8221; cried the stranger,
and grasped his hand. &#8220;You! Doesn&#8217;t that
beat the merry Hell&mdash;elujah? You Kit
Bissant&#8217;s nephew! He stood up for me when
I was a prentice your size. Ever hear him
tell about Florio? Tony Florio? No? That&#8217;s
so, why should he? His nephew, by Jove!
Isn&#8217;t it a funny little world, though?&#8221; With
twinkling eyes, he studied the boy&#8217;s face,
then turned abruptly. &#8220;I&#8217;m off to tackle
the old gentleman. See you later!&#8221;</p>

<p>His footsteps rang hollow and distant on
the gully foot-bridge. Miles, listening, felt
unreasonably glad. Unreasonably, as often,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
in spite of all geography, a long hill suggests
a hidden prospect of plain or ocean, as a turn
of woodland road beckons to some joyful
ambush or far-thought pilgrimage, so the
landfall of this stranger, the alacrity and vigor
of his contact, promised immediate events.
Just what events, the youth, with all his eager
surmise while climbing homeward through
attenuate shadows, could not guess.</p>

<p>Their evening meal&mdash;a haddock usually,
with cornbread, tea, berries, or cheese-cakes&mdash;the
old man always called dinner, and
further dignified by appearing in the crumpled
broadcloth and linen of a bygone generation.
To-night he entered with even greater
solemnity, leading to their bare little table
the sun-burned man in gray.</p>

<p>&#8220;My grandson Miles, Captain Florio,&#8221; he
said. And bending his fierce old countenance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
toward the one flickering candle, he added
in the same breath: &#8220;For the bounty of the
present day, and of all days past and to come,
we thank thee, O Lord, and now seek thy
blessing.&#8221; With the same stiff ceremony, he
did the honors for the haddock, presided
over the raspberries, and ignored the flustered
awkwardness of Ella.</p>

<p>The stranger appeared to enjoy both his
fare and his company.</p>

<p>&#8220;Beautiful country hereabout, Mr. Bissant,&#8221;
he declared heartily. &#8220;Beautiful, by
George! Shore life for me, if &#8217;twas all like
this. I tell you, Miles, we&#8217;ll have a jolly time
together. Show me your lighthouses to-morrow
night, will you? Right! What are
they, fixed? You know, once when I was
wrecked off the Hook of Indramaiu&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He rambled into stories of orient and tropic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
seas. Had they been of anthropophagi and
antres vast, Miles could have listened no
more hungrily; for even at second hand, this
was the life which he once had dreamed. The
sole incredibility was that such a brilliant
tropic wanderer should now shine out in their
gloomy, sequestered house. The mountain
had come to Mahomet, the world to a captive.
His grandfather, visiting Miles at bedtime,
brought explanation.</p>

<p>&#8220;My boy,&#8221; he said&mdash;and for the first
time in their life together he spoke with hesitation,
almost as though making excuses to
an equal&mdash;&#8220;my boy, Captain Florio is to
be our&mdash;that is, hmm! well, our lodger.&#8221;
Frowning at the candle flame, he brought out
the word defiantly. &#8220;I should never consent
to this&mdash;mercenary relation, but it seems&mdash;he
was a friend of my son Christopher&#8217;s. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
will stay with us for some time. It&#8217;s&mdash;it&#8217;s
unnecessary to say more. Good-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>Humiliation underlay the speech&mdash;humiliation
which Miles felt dimly, but could
not share. A lodger&#8217;s money, even a damaged
pride, counted little against the change
from apathy to interest, from silence to fireside
and table talk, from routine to variety.
Next morning, indeed, five minutes after
lessons, Miles had forgotten that the relation
was mercenary.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello,&#8221; Florio hailed him. In jersey and
puttees, he looked like some heavy-weight
amateur training in retirement. &#8220;Look here,
how&#8217;s this? Caught Ella carrying water uphill
from that gully below. There&#8217;s a spring
above.&#8221; He waved up toward the site of the
burned mansion.</p>

<p>&#8220;That hill&#8217;s too steep,&#8221; said Miles.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>&#8220;Ho-ho!&#8221; laughed the other. &#8220;You&#8217;re a
bright boy, aren&#8217;t you, now? Come along
topside with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Two joyful days followed, in which they
built a little wooden aqueduct from the Admiral&#8217;s
Spring down to a trough at Ella&#8217;s
very door. When nails gave out, the seafarer
joined their supports with marvelous
temporary lashings. &#8220;Chinese trick,&#8221; he
grinned. &#8220;Now we&#8217;ll run the flowage down
into your gully. How&#8217;s that, señor?&#8221;</p>

<p>With ties no less secure he had bound Miles
to admiration, as much by his manual cunning,
his boyish enthusiasm for practical
designs, as by his galloping accompaniment
of strange tales. Hammering or sawing like
a born carpenter, he recalled sharp, flashing
pictures of life in antipodes,&mdash;pearl-divers
in Polynesia, &#8220;sun-downers,&#8221; mutinous coolies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
at sea, plague-stricken pilgrims to Mecca
dying like flies, aboard ship; midnight murderers
in sampans.</p>

<p>&#8220;Damn it, no Captains and Misters!&#8221;
he cried once. &#8220;There, I didn&#8217;t mean&mdash;your
grandfather&#8217;ll ship me off for
swearing! But call me Tony. Let&#8217;s be
chums.&#8221;</p>

<p>Chums, therefore, they became, though
not without capitulation. The lighthouses
first showed them certain differences.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean,&#8221; cried the wanderer, as
they stood, one evening, in the glare of the
lamp-room, &#8220;do you mean to say you leave
a warm bed twice every night to watch these
two tame lightning-bugs? Let &#8217;em burn,
boy! Get your sleep. What the devil, they&#8217;ll
not go out; or if they did, who&#8217;d know?
Must be as many as one schooner a fortnight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
pass that ledge after dark. Ho, ho! You stay
in bed!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But it&#8217;s our agreement,&#8221; Miles protested.</p>

<p>The sailor&#8217;s gray eyes twinkled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Roman sentinel, eh? That&#8217;s nonsense,
boy. Take your beauty sleep. Let &#8217;em
burn.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, &#8217;twouldn&#8217;t be honest,&#8221; said the
young keeper, somewhat shocked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Honest?&#8221; jeered Florio. Then his tone
changed. &#8220;Oh, well, no harm done. Strict
ideas&mdash;I s&#8217;pose somebody&#8217;s bound to have
&#8217;em. Tough on you, all the same.&#8221;</p>

<p>The upshot of their argument was that
with high good-nature Tony insisted on
making the last rounds himself. &#8220;I&#8217;m used
to night work. This is my pidgin. You go
to bed.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>The volunteer was faithful. Often thereafter,
waking by force of habit at midnight
or three in the morning, Miles rose from his
pillow to watch, for a luxurious instant, the
sailor&#8217;s lantern bobbing along through underbrush
far below. He dropped asleep with
drowsy gratitude. Yet in spite of kindness
and the ascendency of experience, his new
friend left something unfinished, dubious,
unexplained. To grandfather, the man was
another commercial contract like the light-keeping,
a fender against evil days, a presence
courteously tolerated; to Ella&mdash;and,
through her, perhaps, to the outer world&mdash;a
&#8220;visitin&#8217; gentleman,&#8221; friend of the late
Captain Christopher; to Miles, a frank companion
and&mdash;what?</p>

<p>Why should a man in the thirties, ebullient
and a rover, suddenly choose to vegetate?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
Grandfather had called him &#8220;Mercury Resting.&#8221;
For all his cheerful enthusiasm, the
sailor could care little about their northern
valley, the sad, rugged beauty of their border.
When Miles proposed a favorite tramp, he
had replied: &#8220;Kilmarnock Brook? What&#8217;s
to see there? Nothing but scenery.&#8221; Nor
could books dull the edge of his restlessness.
&#8220;No, thank you. Not much on reading,&#8221; he
replied, when grandfather gave him the freedom
of the meagre &#8220;library.&#8221; And later, out
of doors, he explained to Miles: &#8220;Print&#8217;s
nearly all lies. Now <i>them</i>, why, every day,
right in the open air, you can meet live men
that&#8217;ll tell you <i>them</i>&mdash;fresh lies, not old ones,&mdash;and
act &#8217;em out to boot. So why rack
eyesight over print?&#8221; Meantime, he taught
Miles to box, and with his aid rebuilt the
kitchen chimney, pruned the deserted orchard,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
shored up the Admiral&#8217;s quarter-deck.
Yet these employments could not
last.</p>

<p>Again, he had said, &#8220;I&#8217;m alone in the
world.&#8221; And yet after a tranquil month, he
was plainly fretting about letters. He and
Miles often traversed the river road, up hill
and down, to the half-deserted village of Kilmarnock;
and always on the final crest, the
red granite ledge where, sudden as a night-hawk&#8217;s
downward wheel, the freed vision of
the climbers fell wide over a landward prospect,
following toward the sunset alternate
wedges of bright water and black crenelated
headlands,&mdash;there, always, the sailor paused
and sat down.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll smoke here,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Great view,
eh? Land and water, land and water&mdash;in
layers, like Ella&#8217;s chocolate pie o&#8217; Sundays.&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
Then, nodding toward the slate-gray houses
clustered far below in a meadow cove: &#8220;You
go on down and ask. May be a letter, this
time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Once, when Miles clambered up again,
empty-handed as ever, the sailor sat musing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you keep a secret?&#8221; he asked, with
a glance at once introverted and shrewd.
&#8220;We&#8217;re mates, aren&#8217;t we? Right, then.
You&#8217;re the sort a man can trust. If a
stranger comes asking for me, or any
foreign-looking man, you know, you keep
your tongue at home, and come straight
to me, first. I&#8217;ll tell you why, some day.
Long story&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He watched a slim pillar of smoke rising
from a cottage chimney, out of evening
shadow, to vanish in the breeze on their glowing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
height. Then he sprang up, and started
briskly homeward.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sometimes, you know,&#8221; he said, when
they had scrambled down hill for a furlong,
&#8220;sometimes, at sea, a man makes enemies.&#8221;</p>

<small>THE SAFFRON MAN</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">As</span> warmth in a dying man, so life in the village
of Kilmarnock had retreated from the
extremities. Gray cabins stood for the most
part with sunken roof and yawning window;
here and there, where a wall had fallen out,
they exposed, as for the stage purposes of
some unacted melodrama, the intimacy of all
their little rooms at once,&mdash;the ragged wallpaper,
the zigzag mounting scar of stairs
long vanished, the hearthstones choked, in
winter with snow, as now with autumn chickweed.
Beyond these dead environs, a brook,
with cool and hearty noises, tumbled out of
its brown alder-shadow to halt, slacken, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
wriggle in a delta of deep-channeled rivulets
through seaweed and long mud-flats. And
here, where fairy falls descended to that vile
foreshore, the heart of the village beat feebly
in a half-dozen houses, weather-silvered.</p>

<p>In the post-office,&mdash;a littered, gloomy
shed which was also carpenter&#8217;s shop, wheel-wright&#8217;s
factory, and woolen mill,&mdash;a few
sad old men sat always, talking slowly and
vaguely; while underneath, the roaring brook
made the floor-boards vibrate, and flashed
through chinks and knot-holes the whiteness
of cascade foam.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mornin&#8217;, Miles,&#8221; wheezed Mr. Quinn,
the postmaster. An elephantine man,&mdash;old
Mr. Bissant called him Quinbus Flestrin,
after the man-mountain Gulliver,&mdash;he rummaged
with slow, fat hands in Her Majesty&#8217;s
salt-box. &#8220;Here&#8217;s that letter you folks be&#8217;n<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
waitin&#8217; for,&#8221; he puffed. &#8220;Didn&#8217;t know you
had relations over there, neither. Poor hand
they write, I must say. Oh, <i>now</i> I ketch it!
&#8216;A. Florio, <i>Es</i>-quair.&#8217; That&#8217;s him that&#8217;s
stayin&#8217; up to your place, ain&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Miles nodded, all impatience.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Care of Richard Bissant, <i>Es</i>-quair,&#8217;&#8221;
read Quinbus gravely, holding the letter at
different lengths of focus. &#8220;Say, they tell
me he <i>ain&#8217;t</i> a boarder, after all! Now, I
thought he might be a rusticator, like the
city feller to Lovat&#8217;s that&#8217;s got the narvous
prostrates. They say his fingers fidges dretful,
that feller.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miles listened politically, and was at last
rewarded with Tony&#8217;s letter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hear ye got noo neighbors down your
way,&#8221; began Quinbus, but his auditor escaped.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>His news, moreover, went unheeded; for
in three steps down the grass-ribbed street
Miles overtook a surprise. A little man
trundling a keg of nails in a barrow set down
the handles with a sigh, and turned. His hair
was grayer, his cheek engraved with deeper
lines, his aspect less cheerful and thriving;
but the swart face and shifting black eyes
were those of Abram the Magician.</p>

<p>It was like a piece of boyhood restored.
Halting, Miles ventured the question,&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t your name Tucker, sir?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What if &#8217;tis?&#8221; growled the man, defiant
and suspicious.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, nothing,&#8221; rejoined Miles, taken aback.
&#8220;Only I rode your mare Jubilee once&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dessay,&#8221; snapped Abram. He spat on his
hands, stooped to the shafts of his barrow,
and growled, &#8220;Lots o&#8217; lummockses did.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
Damn &#8217;er hide! Dunno that&#8217;s reason to hender
a man&#8217;s work.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Or to be uncivil,&#8221; Miles retorted stiffly,
taking a leaf from his grandfather&#8217;s book of
pride. But it was with a chuckle that he
passed on, and swung into the path along
the shore.</p>

<p>It was a bright Saturday morning of late
September. Across the border a thin haze
of forest fires, from &#8220;back lots&#8221; far behind
the river hills, veiled the high, resolute contours
of the American shore; but in all other
quarters the air shone clear and buoyant,
mellow but cordial, like the sweetness of a
frosty apple. Goldenrod along his path had
ripened to a higher, drier yellow; seaweed on
the rocks below&mdash;that turned the broad flats
into a &#8220;rookery&#8221; of shaggy forms, petrified
in the act of basking&mdash;seemed to have lost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
the greenish tinge from its leathern brown;
ahead, down the sparkling vista of the river,
the bay, by a sleight of mirage, raised islands
a hair&#8217;s-breadth above the horizon, till beneath
them sea and sky joined with that
pale, stretched continuity seen in downward-parting
drops. A world unclouded and
untroubled: yet the sky held the growing
whiteness that foreruns autumnal wind, and
a loon, winging high with bedlam laughter,
steered his flight by the flight of an unrisen
gale.</p>

<p>Miles loitered, yet was busy rather with
thought than sight. What could bring Abram
to Kilmarnock? The fat postmaster would
have not only mentioned a &#8220;show,&#8221; but discussed
it tediously; where, then, were Terry
and Jubilee, and Madge the Seeress, and the
little barefoot girl? His sudden sharp curiosity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
above all on this last head, astonished
him. Why should he care?&mdash;yet he continued
to speculate.</p>

<p>His path skirted among sweet-fern, mullein,
and pink granite. The little fir promontory,
roughly double-serrate like the edge of an
elm leaf, suddenly hid the upper lighthouse,
for shore and path bent sharp into Alward&#8217;s
Cove. Here a deserted house stood at the
grassy mouth of an ancient watercourse;
and behind it, a grove of slender white birches
had already begun to shed yellow leaves,
which so carpeted the dark, strait hollow that
a sunlight seemed to glow faintly upward.</p>

<p>Suddenly Miles saw that new shingles
patched the cabin, and that from the chimney
curled blue wisps of smoke. A battered
&#8220;punt&#8221; lay hauled above the thin rubbish
line of high water. But what most deeply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
surprised him, the beginnings of a weir
straggled down the beach. He laughed aloud.
The stakes were freshly driven, but the cedar
poles green-coated with many tides; on old
material the builder had exerted an inexperience
glaring even in these first few yards;
and more than all, Alward&#8217;s Cove, a narrow
cleft half a mile above low water, was for a
weir the worst possible situation.</p>

<p>Glancing up at the patched house, he cut
his laughter short. Behind the panes a girl&#8217;s
face vanished into the gloom. The features
he could not have sworn to, but the hair
shone indubitably bright. Ashamed to be
caught mocking her weir, he set out again
briskly; and he had rounded the little promontory
before confusion cleared into the
surprising knowledge that he was glad of
something. These were the neighbors of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
whom Quinbus would have told; the keg of
nails was for that absurd, futile weir; and her
hair <i>was</i> of the color of winter oak leaves.
Why, again, should he care?&mdash;but care he
did, even to excitement, with an obscure
feeling that his acts, even his thoughts, now
had as it were a witness, and that now any
day could promise pleasant and unexpected
turns. He could not account for this glowing
satisfaction,&mdash;that some one had become
mysteriously involved and identified, in his
mind, with the bright, volatile strangeness of
autumn.</p>

<p>On the doorsteps at home, Tony smoked
his pipe.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, the beggar&#8217;s written at last,&#8221; he
grumbled; then unfolding a single sheet,
read it calmly, without comment. Miles,
who had always vaguely connected this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
coming letter with &#8220;enemies made at sea,&#8221;
was disappointed to see no more change
in Florio&#8217;s dark face than in his later
behavior.</p>

<p>Weeks passed without incident. Miles
went daily to the village for mail which was
never there, and of which the sailor declared
no expectation. He returned down river
always by the shore path&mdash;&#8220;to see how the
weir gets along,&#8221; he told himself stubbornly.
It got along slowly, from bad to worse.
Sometimes he saw the magician, far out,
ankle-deep in mud, hammering stakes, or
weaving brush wattles into his foredoomed
structure. Once the blue of a calico dress
moved among the white birch pillars. Speech
of his new neighbors, however, or nearer
view, he did not get. No face lurked behind
the window-pane. And at home the fir headland<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
sundered them as effectually as the rim
of a hemisphere.</p>

<p>One night, at his nine-o&#8217;clock visit to the
upper light, he paused for a time in the lamp-room,
his back to the glare, looking out into
the dark. Something&mdash;perhaps the silence
of the evening, the calm, so great that the
other tower&#8217;s light pierced the water deeply,
like an inverted point of exclamation&mdash;induced
lonely and melancholy thoughts. As he
stood thus, a sound rose through the open
trap-door. Something stirred, thinly and
dryly, on the stairs below.</p>

<p>At first like faintly tearing silk, or scuffing
sand-paper, it mounted. Footsteps, thought
Miles; yet such footsteps as he had never
heard, uncertain, soft, and of a person neither
shod nor barefoot.</p>

<p>They stopped. A harsh yet guarded call<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
followed. If speech, it was no human tongue.
Miles waited, in a profound silence. A voice
called in strange sing-song; then nearer,
chanting what sounded like a fragment of
barbarous melody.</p>

<p>Portuguese and Italian sailors Miles had
seen, on rare visits aboard some lumber
schooner bound for Sicily or the Canary
Islands. At Admiral&#8217;s Light, however, nothing
could bring them ashore, still less up
into the tower. And this sing-song gabble,
as instinct told him, came from no Latin
throat.</p>

<p>The dry, scuffing steps began once more.
Suddenly, out of the darkness, claw-like fingers
clutched the sides of the trap-door,&mdash;fingers
of an impossible, horny yellow, ending
in blue talons.</p>

<p>For one spasmodic instant, Miles, had he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
stood on open ground, might have bolted.
Then as up from a pit, a reassuring black
felt hat bobbed through the opening, and
tilted back to disclose a human face. Eyes
hard and bright as black glass peered from
under lids curiously in-folded, of double
thickness; the saffron cheeks were smooth
as a babe&#8217;s; and indeed, in that strange face,
as in a changeling&#8217;s, baby innocence conflicted
with reptilian age and wisdom. Without
alteration, without sound, it rested there
for a moment, at the level of the floor, as
though decapitated; then sank from sight.</p>

<p>Miles had stared in fascination. Waking
to anger, part at his own fear, part at its
cause, he shouted:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop! Who&mdash;what are you after?&#8221;</p>

<p>The light scuffing descended rapidly. Miles
leapt for the black square, plunged through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
it, and down the twisting stair. The thin
scantling shook and buckled under their
double weight. He jumped the lower steps,
just as the tower door slammed open to let
a black figure bound out into the lantern
light. A scurrying pair of thick white soles,
as he caught up the lantern by the bail,
guided his pursuit; he gained on them, and
running his hardest to the gully bridge,
gripped in his right hand the fluttering fullness
of a silken jacket.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;You&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The fugitive tugged, wriggled, surrendered,
and turned a grinning face.</p>

<p>&#8220;No can do,&#8221; he panted, nodding and
ducking amiably. The felt hat was gone, and
his bobbing crown showed a high, shaven
forehead, bound with neat black coils of
braided hair. &#8220;But in pictures they hang<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
down,&#8221; thought Miles. &#8220;A queue!&#8221; He had
never before seen a Chinaman.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you want?&#8221; he asked severely.</p>

<p>His captive, smiling and nodding, the
calmer of the two, repeated,&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;No can do, no can do.&#8221;</p>

<p>Plainly, the man&#8217;s English went no further.
Miles released his grip, and, feeling rather
foolish, stepped back to consider. Like a
spring released, and with instant, mechanical
precision, the Chinaman vaulted the bridge-rail,
landed on the steep bank below, and
darted upward, crashing into the alders.
His escape, like his first appearance, had the
facility of acts in a dream.</p>

<p>Flushed and bewildered, Miles was halfway
home before he regained the use of
reason. At a clap the thought overtook him,
What if this were Tony&#8217;s &#8220;foreign-looking&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
enemy? &#8220;I&#8217;d better make sure first,&#8221; he
told himself; and sitting by the library fire,
he kept as thoughtful a silence as his grandfather
and the sailor, perched, with intent
faces, over their chessmen.</p>

<p>At bedtime, he stepped across into Florio&#8217;s
little room.</p>

<p>&#8220;News for you,&#8221; he began quietly, and
continued in an undertone. Florio&#8217;s hard
gray eyes watched him sharply across the
candle flame, with a look which meant, if
anything, impatient anger.</p>

<p>An explosive whisper was the only comment:
&#8220;Damn the coolie!&#8221; Pocketing his
big fists with one energetic shove, the sailor
stared down at the floor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks all the same, of course,&#8221; he said
moodily. &#8220;Quite right. That&#8217;s the chap I
was afraid might turn up. Thanks. Don&#8217;t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
speak of him to anybody else, till I say so,
will you? Not a word? That&#8217;s right.&#8221;</p>

<p>He sat down on his bed, and unwound his
leggings, neatly, methodically, as though the
affair were dropped.</p>

<p>In some surprise, Miles continued it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll do my turns to-night, and afterward&mdash;the
lamps.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221; The sailor looked up, half startled,
half chagrined. &#8220;What&#8217;s that?&mdash;Oh,&#8221; he
smiled indulgently, &#8220;not much! Get to bed,
boy. What, I&#8217;m not afraid of <i>that</i> swine!
Alone, isn&#8217;t he? Let me lay aboard him
once, that&#8217;s all! Can catch! No, I won&#8217;t
hear a word of it. Your watch below. To
bed!&#8221;</p>

<p>By no persuasion would he forego his self-set
labor, or accept company, even for the
single night. &#8220;Dear chap, I have <i>some</i> pride,&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
he reiterated; and as he offered no confidences,
Miles left him with disappointment. Yet his
cool, stubborn attitude seemed, in a way,
admirable; and&mdash;to judge from deep, contented
breathing, across the corridor&mdash;he
slept like a child.</p>

<p>Somewhere after midnight, Miles woke
uneasily. Long security had broken the
habit; but now he sat up once more, to watch
the distant light of Tony&#8217;s lantern jerking
in fitful eclipse among the firs. Near the
second tower it disappeared, as usual; and as
usual, after a short pause shining out again,
returned down river, skipping and winking.</p>

<p>Suddenly it went out, and shone no more.</p>

<p>Miles crept from bed to window, and
watched. He counted off three, four, five
minutes, and saw not another gleam. Dismayed,
blaming himself for suffering Tony<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
to have his way, he wrestled into clothes,
stole downstairs, and raced through the
sharp night air. Thin fog, shoulder-high,
had just begun to billow along the ground,
concealing and magnifying, even by starlight.
Each tussock, each baby fir, loomed like a
waiting figure or stretched like a dead body.
Silent over the wet grass, Miles ran downhill
toward the spot where the light had
ceased.</p>

<p>Nearing the shore, he brushed through the
chill aspersion of bristling thickets, when
suddenly the light gleamed again, fixed,
through the lowest boughs. He stopped,
listened, then slipped forward cautiously,
toward a murmur of voices. Subdued but
unmistakable, it was the broken sing-song
of that speech from the other side of the
world. He threaded without a sound the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
interstitial windings of the underbrush, and
crouched at the edge of the clearing.</p>

<p>On the old quarter-deck, the lantern burned
dimly. As in a luminous smoke, two men
sat talking, with now and then a gesture
that set enormous hands, outspread fingers,
wavering on the magic-lantern screen of the
fog. Their alien tones rose and fell, in a
quiet, scolding incantation.</p>

<p>The more vehement speaker was Tony.
Facing him, oddly squatting upon heels, the
yellow man of the tower nodded continually,
amicably, sagely, like a toy mandarin.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> breakfast Tony discoursed readily as
ever, smiled as engagingly, with glances no
less frank, provocative, or droll. Twice he
forced old Mr. Bissant to brighten his cloudy
morning face, to smite with open palm his
short white curls, and chuckle; once, even,
to parry joke with joke. But Miles sat dazed
and unhappy. Their little house, lacking
so many things, had lacked also the presence
of a lie; before that presence, now, he came
awkwardly, and as it were with eyes averted.
He heard Tony laugh, saw the white flash
of his teeth, the quick, foreign heave of his
burly shoulders, the nameless turns of speech
and look by which friend signals to friend;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
he knew Tony for the same man of yesterday,
challenging the same admiration; yet between
himself and all this, a single night had
stretched a dismal vacuum, a distance slight,
but both intensive and insulating. The sudden
change puzzled him abominably.</p>

<p>&#8220;An Italianate Englishman,&#8221; his grandfather
descanted, &#8220;they used to call a devil
incarnate. I leave it to fancy what an Italian
who&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aha, but I&#8217;m not!&#8221; cried Tony warmly.
&#8220;I have you there. My father was Italian
born, yes. That&#8217;s only half. And me, bless
you, I sailed out on an English ship a twelve-year-old.
Under the same flag ever since.
An English deck is English soil. Come now,
Mr. Bissant, to be honest&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>While their debate ran high, Miles slipped
quietly from the room.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>Last night&#8217;s fog had poured up the channel,
overflowed the hills, and now submerged
all but the smoky loom of the hackmatack
pillars, as Miles passed between them. Sea-rime
silvered his rough jacket; from beneath
wet eyelashes he peered into motionless,
white space; the very hill underfoot was a
declivity felt, not seen. He wandered slowly
down it, hands in pockets, head bent.</p>

<p>To be honest! Tony&#8217;s chance phrase recurred
ironically; and after it, his saying on
the hill above Kilmarnock, &#8220;You&#8217;re the
sort a man can trust.&#8221; With what? thought
Miles bitterly: with lies, calculated, shaped
as confidences. He had not known, before,
how utterly the older man had captured his
liking; or how, divorced from belief, liking
could become reproach. A raw simpleton,
to lend a stranger his heart!</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>In this mood he found himself halting,
without purpose, on the Admiral&#8217;s quarter-deck.
From the rail he saw neither rocks nor
river, but only the globular, spiny tufts of
young Norway pines that stepped down
toward the beach. Wind-slanted, rooted in
crevices, they lent their fixity as a gauge to
sight: their needles, carding sluggish vapor,
freed the spellbound air; formlessness became
texture; and fleecy filaments dissolving,
twining, blending, thick as the smoke of wet
brushwood, set the whole snowy void adrift
in level motion. Somewhere, far below in
the bay, a whistle mournfully bellowed.
Nearer home, but deep in the fog, sounded
the unsteady bumping of a single oar.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hallo-o-o!&#8221; The rowing stopped; and
a moment later the same high, clear voice
called, &#8220;Hallo-o-o!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>Miles trumpeted through his hands an
answering hail.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; cried the rower, with evident relief.
&#8220;Hallo again. Are you a vessel or the
shore?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m the shore,&#8221; laughed Miles. &#8220;What&#8217;s
wrong?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m lost out here.&#8221; The voice, floating
across the hidden surface, rang clear as from
the throat of a singer. &#8220;One oar went overboard,
and the more I pull, the faster this
thing goes round and round. And the tide&#8217;s
running down&mdash;out, I mean&mdash;and I&#8217;m frightened.&#8221;
The bumping noise broke in again,
and again ceased. &#8220;No use! Hallo! Why,
now you&#8217;re clear round on the <i>other</i> side!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stay where you are!&#8221; cried Miles eagerly.
&#8220;Wait. There&#8217;s no danger. I&#8217;ll come out
and tow you.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>He scrambled down to the beach, and
along it to where Tony, for no apparent use,
maintained a small boat moored on an endless
rope. Hauling home till the black bow
came cleaving the fog, he ordered peremptorily,&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep on shouting, there! What&#8217;s the
matter with you? How can I find&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was just thinking,&#8221; replied the voice
calmly, from no great distance. &#8220;If you come
out, you may get lost, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miles cast off, and jumped in.</p>

<p>&#8220;On this river?&#8221; He laughed somewhat
breathlessly, half at the warning, half at a
strange excitement which had mastered him.
This drifting voice he had known, from the
first hail, to be a girl&#8217;s; what girl&#8217;s, he had
nearly guessed from the second; and pulling
vigorous oars, he was not surprised to see,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
after blind exploration and shouting, the
square bow of the magician&#8217;s punt focusing
from out the heavy smoke.</p>

<p>Bareheaded, half turned on a thwart, and
peering anxiously through that smoke, sat
a misty figure, whose light, strong lines of
active youth not even a man&#8217;s cardigan
jacket could muffle. She gave a little cry of
deliverance.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s fine of you&mdash;&#8221; Something cut her
praise curiously short, just as gunwale swept
gunwale.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come aboard,&#8221; said Miles. Sheepish,
and suddenly flushed, he found himself out
of all measure preoccupied with an unshipped
oar. &#8220;Careful. Step in the middle,&#8221; he
added mechanically. His outstretched hand
met a warm, firm little grasp, in the same
delighted instant that two ankles, quick and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
slender as the feathered ankles of mythology,
whipped over into the bottom of the
boat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Make fast your painter,&#8221; he ordered,
shipping his oar in a dream.</p>

<p>&#8220;Make my what?&#8221; cried his passenger
anxiously. He managed at last to look up,
and saw her darting puzzled glances into the
punt. Cold vapors wavered about her hair
thinly, as though conquered and dispersed
by lambent brightness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tie the rope,&#8221; he translated.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, this!&#8221; She obeyed, her nimble fingers
rosy with the cold, her shining head bent
so zealously over the knot as to show but one
brown cheek transparently aglow with exercise.</p>

<p>Watching this with unbounded pleasure,
he gave way. The punt fell behind, swung<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
dimly into their wake; the rope rose taut and
dripping; and as though satisfied with her
knot, the girl suddenly faced him, brushing
from her forehead an obstinate tendril of
bright hair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you for coming,&#8221; she said quietly.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t&mdash;I don&#8217;t know anything about
boats.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again a fragment of boyhood restored:
he met that look of elfin gravity, under the
wide circumflex of eyebrows, more formidable
than bows bent against him.</p>

<p>&#8220;How did you get lost?&#8221; he ventured in
confusion; and, meaning kindness, was dismayed
to hear the question ring like a
rebuke.</p>

<p>&#8220;Weir-poles&mdash;a whole lot drifted out of
our cove,&#8221; she answered, with a flutter of
the same confusion. &#8220;He had worked so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
hard&mdash;It was a pity to lose so many. I had
to come out after them. He was&mdash;isn&#8217;t very
well.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your father?&#8221; asked Miles.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied the girl uncertainly. Another
flush, a deeper color in her cheeks,
allowed him to guess at Abram&#8217;s illness.
&#8220;No; I call him that, but&mdash;he&#8217;s all I have;
and she was so good to me&mdash;his wife. She
sent me to school winters, and wouldn&#8217;t let&mdash;as
long as she lived&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Her words, lingering unfinished, her look
penetrating the hidden distances of the fog,
seemed to dismiss a memory down some long
vista.</p>

<p>&#8220;Were you afraid?&#8221; said Miles, between
strokes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I was,&#8221; she laughed. Her instant
change of mood, her glance swiftly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
returning to close quarters, but above all the
radiant conflict about lips and eyes, the honest
mischief and shy directness, struck him
into a panic joy. No countenance had ever
looked so quick with various meaning, so
tremulous with color, so dangerously awake
and alive, as her face now in this floating
dawn, this cold, nebulous, elemental light of
the sea mist. It was a discovery in his life,
a mystery, and a power. He could have ferried
her to the farthest continent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Afraid?&#8221; she said. &#8220;What else? I
thought I was slipping out into the big ocean.
And the fog all round! It was like&mdash;like
sitting alone with a lot of years. I thought of
my sins!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t have many.&#8221; The words
sprang from impulse, free admiration; he
could have hammered out no compliments;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
but she willfully mistook him, and laughed
his honesty aside.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah now, what a tongue you have!&#8221; And
with a provoking smile, bending aside her
look, she studied the smoky water that drew
astern. Under the gray cardigan jacket, her
slight, active body in the blue calico reminded
him oddly of nacre shining in some uncouth
shell, or of hazelnuts when frost has split
the rough beard.</p>

<p>A strange motive, as strong as it was new,
forced him to say:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;The first time I saw you&mdash;&#8221; All conclusion
suddenly failed him. &#8220;Do you remember
it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Remember?&#8221; Again, and more deeply,
she watched the slow sweep of the current;
and more deeply her blood tinted the sun-burned,
oval face. She tossed her head with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
a little shake, more of impatience than of
denial. &#8220;No, I&mdash;I can&#8217;t remember.&#8221;</p>

<p>Disappointed, frustrated, he rowed for a
space in silence, knowing that the full career
of their speech had swerved awry. In a
twinkling she had withdrawn to a lamentable
distance.</p>

<p>&#8220;But Jubilee?&#8221; persisted Miles. &#8220;And
Terry, and the dog&mdash;what became&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All sold,&#8221; answered the girl curtly. &#8220;When
she died. Sold off. Poor little old Terry!&#8221;
For a moment she sat alone with her thoughts;
then suddenly lifting her head, listened.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; Her tone was hard as
business. &#8220;Do you hear it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Miles heard, and not without anxiety. A
steady, muffled puffing sound labored doggedly
nearer through the fog. Against an
ebb-tide that raced for the bay and open sea,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
he had rowed indifferently, his arms working,
but his thoughts inclining to let the boat
drift. In the charmed isolation of the fog,
it had become, for the instant, a barge of
glory, a shallop of dreams. Awake now, he
recognized that the &#8220;back-eddy&#8221; which swept
the shore toward Alward&#8217;s Cove had not yet
seized their keel; that they were still in the
channel; that the channel was none too wide,
and the approaching noise none too far
astern. He swung full power on his port oar.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; repeated the girl, peering
over her shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Trim the boat,&#8221; he commanded. &#8220;Can&#8217;t
tell. We&#8217;re all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>But of this he felt by no means sure. The
steady &#8220;puff-puff&#8221; throbbed more and more
distinct, and with it came a wide whisper of
rushing water. The vagueness of all direction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
told him that to shout, in this thick obscurity,
would only alarm his passenger. He
tugged mightily across the current, hoping
for the sudden wrench of the counter-eddy.
It did not grasp them. Instead, the noise
fought closer, truculent and panting; the
whisper of rushing surfaces widened and
sharpened, more and more sibilant.</p>

<p>A silent explosion seemed to hoist the laggard
stern of the punt, which instantly, as
though stung into live hatred, came crashing
along their port side, crowding and struggling
like a horse that fights his mate in harness.
Struck by this trough of whirling suds, an
oar shot into the air. With a stagger, the
boat careened as to capsize, slewed violently
on a soft upheaval. Through the mist, a
pear-shaped bag of woven cordage stole past
like a phantom, above a low black bulwark;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
at interminable intervals, three heavy stakes
filed along, almost overhead,&mdash;fenders hanging
parallel at the same forward slant. Their
boat, righting dizzily, leaped once, cramped
and awkward as a sheep jumping a wall.
And they were left pitching on a foamy
wake, smothered in the smell of steam,
wrapped by a warm mist invisible in a
cold.</p>

<p>&#8220;The oar! The oar!&#8221; cried Miles.</p>

<p>Long afterward, he admired her instant
foresight. She had already caught the oar-blade,
just as it bobbed past in hissing lather.
The tug steadily puffed farther into the distance,
and&mdash;now that their need was over&mdash;began
again the hoarse bellowing which Miles
had heard in the bay. For some moments,
exchanging a queer smile that conveyed more
than utterance, each saw the other&#8217;s face<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
touched, through the gleaming fog, with a
light still more pale and northern.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bail her out,&#8221; said Miles, nodding at the
half-filled punt, while he wrestled with
broken thole-pins. When at last they were
under way, it was in silence.</p>

<p>And yet danger had advanced each in the
other&#8217;s knowledge, by that shared experience
which was more than words, presence, or
time&mdash;so savage, so close upon the happy side
of life, had flashed the traitorous. Hidden
together on the river, in a privacy of space,
they had heard the pipes of Pan the gracious,
and now Pan the terrible had &#8220;stamped his
hoof in the night thicket.&#8221;</p>

<p>The waves of their enemy&#8217;s wake broke
widely along the shore, with a pleasant sound
as of the sea, but roving and transitory. The
eddy at last eased the laboring oars. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
by some mystery of the air, the fog began to
blur and dissolve, to rise from a clearing
circle of water, from the shaggy, wallowing
rocks, the pink granite walls, the sombre
undergrowth, till the fir-tops reared like a
parapet in the thick of a siege, with ragged
embrasures and sharp merlons bosomed in
the smoke of cannonades.</p>

<p>&#8220;Almost home,&#8221; said Miles. And while
he spoke, numberless floating bladders of
seaweed brushed beneath, clogged the speed
of their boat, and then let it pass into clear
water at Alward&#8217;s. The weir, a string of
cedar poles, like the tops of a sunken fence,
ran a broken parallel to their shoreward
course.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop a minute,&#8221; begged the girl.</p>

<p>Very willingly he backed water, then rested
his oars.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>&#8220;Before we get within hearing.&#8221; She eyed
him with grave decision. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been worried,
and I want your&mdash;somebody&#8217;s advice.&#8221;
Lowering her voice, she glanced at the weir:
&#8220;Could a man make his living by that?&#8221;</p>

<p>Miles shook his head gloomily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never in the world. I&#8217;m sorry, but&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks. I thought so,&#8221; she interrupted.
&#8220;I told him, but he doesn&#8217;t seem to care.
What will become&mdash;&#8221; Her smile was
friendly but sad. &#8220;I&#8217;m breaking orders: the
one thing he won&#8217;t let me do is to talk to
strangers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are we?&#8221; said Miles, more gloomily.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know we are,&#8221; she answered, looking
down. &#8220;In one way, no. If that thing
had passed over us, out there&mdash;&#8221; The gray
cardigan did not hide a passing shiver. For
a time her bright head remained drooping.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
&#8220;No, we&#8217;re not. I&#8217;ll ask you. Do you know
a man named Florio?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do I?&#8221; he cried. &#8220;He lives with us,
down there!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is he?&#8221; she asked eagerly. &#8220;What
does he do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing,&#8221; answered Miles, with a puzzled
scowl. &#8220;I&mdash;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He and my father seem,&#8221; she began,
then paused. &#8220;Has he anything to do with
fish&mdash;with herring?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Except to eat them!&#8221; Laughing at her
incongruous picture of Tony, Miles suddenly
felt a new and curious pang. &#8220;Do you like
him?&#8221;</p>

<p>She would not look up.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I hate him!&#8221; Her answer trembled
with vehemence. &#8220;Row, please. Quick, I
must get home!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>He gave way once more, unaccountably
glad. The bow, lifting, grated in sludgy sand.
Neither spoke until he had dragged the
magician&#8217;s punt well up the beach. Though
standing nearly shoulder-high beside him,
she had grown, as if at the touch of land,
magically smaller; yet her presence, her influence,
freed from the confines of the boat
and the mist, not only stood more remote
but reared more alarming. Their adventure,
which had seemed limitless, now poignantly
ended.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope,&#8221; he began, &#8220;I hope&mdash;&#8221; He
longed vaguely to offer help, but against
what? And why did she still look down, as
though afraid or angry?</p>

<p>&#8220;What ye doin&#8217; down there?&#8221; growled a
thick, slurring voice. &#8220;Good-f&#8217;r-nothin&#8217;,
traipsin&#8217;&mdash;told ye&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>The bank and upper shore formed a layer
of solid reality, below the brooding unreality
of the fog. The little house, gray and raggedly
patched, stood close at hand, against
the white shafts of birches. In the open door
stood Abram, swaying blindly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come &#8217;ere!&#8221; he grumbled. &#8220;Come &#8217;ere
to me! I&#8217;ll learn ye&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He brandished an uncertain fist, lurched
a step forward, and stumbled. The rising
bank hid his fall.</p>

<p>Without looking back, the girl went slowly
up the beach.</p>

<small>THE HIGH WOODS</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">&#8220;Signs</span> ain&#8217;t no great, I never &#8217;lowed,&#8221; said
Ella thoughtfully. Sweeping her knife in a
neat semicircle, she pared the dough round
the edge of a tin plate. The sweet, steamy
breath of apple pies filled the kitchen, consorting
genially with the soft, high sunshine
reflected upward from snow-fields without.
&#8220;No more ducks&#8217; breast-bon&#8217;s for me! November,
and see there!&#8221; She pointed at the
frosty window-panes. &#8220;Open winter! What&#8217;s
a shut? And for cold, why, &#8217;fore breakfast,
the what&#8217;s-name&#8217;s &#8217;way down below the
other thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>She knelt before the stove, cautiously placed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
her newest product, and rose muttering, her
freckled cheeks, powdered with flour, rouged
with heat from the oven.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t tell me!&#8221; she grumbled, as though
taxing Miles with the weather&#8217;s iniquity.
&#8220;Yisterday, fall. To-morrow, winter. Onseasonable,
and ondignified, like&#8217;s if the
powers was playin&#8217; us tricks. &#8217;Tain&#8217;t the wet
kind that goes, but the dry that keeps aholt.
Below what&#8217;s-name, too. Beats Old Roper!&#8221;</p>

<p>Through the glistening stillness came a
thin, mellow jingle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sleigh-bells!&#8221; Ella nodded, with an air
of angry wisdom. &#8220;Another year gone. Shoo-fly!
No more&#8217;n last week, first mud to out
on wheels; and here&#8217;s them things a-calangalin&#8217;
round again!&#8221;</p>

<p>Helpless against this revolution of the seasons,
Miles laughed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>&#8220;Not my fault, Ella.&#8221; Listening to the
jog-trot cadence of the bells, he added,
&#8220;They&#8217;re coming here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t neither&mdash;yes, they are too!&#8221; Ella
bustled to the back window, and, twisting her
apron into knots, stared eagerly up the
smooth, white heave of the hill. &#8220;Who&#8217;ll
it be, s&#8217;pose? All is, he&#8217;ll break out our
ro&#8217;d for us! I&#8217;d ought to reco&#8217;nize any bells
o&#8217; twenty mile round&mdash;do, too. Them&#8217;s
either Old-Hab, or Lazy-Hab, or Cal Martin
the tinker.&#8221;</p>

<p>Against the pale sky, with a slow and
broken jangling of bells, appeared a sorrel
horse. He shambled steeply down, knee-deep
in drifts, yet straining to hold back a
broad sled. The driver, swathed to the eyes,
precariously embraced a sled stake, like a
trained bear hugging his pole.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>&#8220;Old-Hab&#8217;s hoss,&#8221; reported Ella.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ho there, Danamite!&#8221; sounded a smothered
growl. The bells cut their music short;
and a moment later Old-Hab himself battered
the door, and, entering, unwound a
woolen muffler white-furred with frozen
breath. His bony cheeks, at last uncovered,
shone glazed and flaming.</p>

<p>&#8220;By the hokey,&#8221; he grumbled, breathing
sharp and stamping his yellow &#8220;larrigans&#8221;
on the oilcloth. &#8220;Smells good in here, Miss
Dawson. Black as night, too. Takes this
piercifyin&#8217; cold to aidge a man&#8217;s stummick
and file his teeth. Dretful holler, this
weather!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Eatin&#8217;! What did I say?&#8221; With the ready
grievance of a comedian, Ella turned to Miles.
&#8220;Eatin&#8217;, I says, is the first word Hab Belden
speaks inside this house! There ye go.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>The teamster, unmoved, began to shed
jacket after jacket,&mdash;a grimy sheep-fleece,
a worn reefer, a faded blanket coat belted
with tarred rope. After each struggle he
diminished in bulk, as though peeling layer
by layer to the core; till at last, dashing his
cap on the discarded pile, he emerged like
Burleigh from the Lord Treasurer, and stood
forth as a little, wiry, beardless man in a
brown jersey. His narrow body, sharp, frost-red
features, and Indian hair brushed fiercely
back in coarse lines, gave him an eager, windswept
air, as of a weather-cock facing the
winter blast. In a gusty way he veered upon
Ella.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can talk like Day o&#8217; Pentecost,&#8221;
he said, admiring. &#8220;But don&#8217;t tell us ye
can&#8217;t beat the old house afire at cookin&#8217;!
I says to &#8217;em all, up Sweet Water way,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
they can&#8217;t use the same oven with Ella
Dawson.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shoo-fly,&#8221; retorted the cook contemptuously.
None the less, she rummaged for
dishes, and slowly arranged them on the table.
The flatterer was soon plying an expert
knife.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Mr. Mile,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;I&#8217;ve
come o&#8217; business to your gran&#8217;father. Consarns
you, but no hurry. Cares can wait:
Old Appetite, not so.&mdash;Now, why don&#8217;t a
handy girl like that ever git merried?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Much!&#8221; cried Ella angrily. She turned
her back, and stared out at window, muttering,
&#8220;Waste time ketchin&#8217; some glutteron
to cook for?&#8221; No one but a Bissant might
have known what memory her scorn disguised,
or in what gale Ben Constantine went
overboard, thirty years ago.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>A feeble step came down the passage. The
inner door opened.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mornin&#8217;, Mr. Bissant.&#8221; Their visitor
finished his coffee at a gulp and sprang up,
nodding and ducking. &#8220;Health fust rate, I
hope, sir?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fair, thank you,&#8221; replied the Admiral&#8217;s
brother. &#8220;And yours, Mr. Belden?&#8221; His
white head inclined gravely. Perhaps it was
the upward-slanting glow in the sunny
kitchen, perhaps some subtler effect of the
strange, untimely cold; but of late, and now
especially, he seemed to Miles far more old
and frail. Age had stolen upon him in his
chamber, as winter had surprised the yellow
autumn fields.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mine&#8217;s tol&#8217;able, thank ye,&#8221; replied the
teamster. &#8220;Now fust crack, sir, here&#8217;s the
whole point, and no offense. I&#8217;m bound up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
to High Woods, after cord-wood; also to
mark handy spots, p&#8217;r&#8217;aps, for gittin&#8217; out
knees. Sleddin&#8217;&#8217;s fine: might be Feb&#8217;uary.
Now to Kilmarnock is neither youngsters
ner able bodies. No one free to go but
my son, Lazy-Hab, who ain&#8217;t no great, all
knows, beside he&#8217;s a hard-o&#8217;-hearin&#8217; man.
I got kind o&#8217; desprit. &#8216;What, miss all
that splendid goin&#8217;?&#8217; thinks I. &#8216;Won&#8217;t
neither. There&#8217;s young Mr. Mile, the bigness
of a man a&#8217;ready.&#8217; Now all I ask is,
will he ride along o&#8217; me, week or ten
days, and do a man&#8217;s work for a man&#8217;s
wages?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; replied old Mr. Bissant
in slow surprise. &#8220;It&#8217;s pretty cold, Habakkuk.
The mercury showed&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My feelin&#8217;s is better&#8217;n any old jibometer!&#8221;
cried the other recklessly. &#8220;&#8217;Scuse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
my common way, sir, but it&#8217;ll do the young
man good.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;True for once!&#8221; cried Ella, with sudden
animation. &#8220;Let him go! If anybody ever
needed a change! He&#8217;s been mopin&#8217; and
sykin&#8217; about this house like a sweetheart
in a picture book!&#8221;</p>

<p>Miles felt his grandfather&#8217;s eyes fasten
on him so odd a scrutiny that he gladly heard
the interruption of Tony&#8217;s laugh. &#8220;Yes, let
him go skylark,&#8221; called the sailor, lounging
in from the passage. &#8220;The lad&#8217;s been
cooped up till he&#8217;s stale. I&#8217;ll keep all ship-shape
for him here. This last fortnight he&#8217;s
hardly spoken to us&mdash;sour even on his old
mate!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right, Florio. You&#8217;re always
right.&#8221; The old man nodded. Seldom had
his wrinkled face appeared so tolerant, his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
eyes and voice so regretful and kindly. &#8220;I
hate to lose you out of sight, boy, but&mdash;perhaps&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Slip your cable!&#8221; laughed Tony.</p>

<p>So Miles went with Habakkuk Belden
to the High Woods.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thought he&#8217;d knock under,&#8221; chuckled
the teamster, as they slid jingling through
the powdery snow. &#8220;Here, Mile, drive
Danamite whilst I git a pipeful o&#8217; Mundungo.
Yes, sir, a turr&#8217;ble persuadin&#8217; tongue
I got, if a man can brag o&#8217; gifts. The pen
of a ready writer! But the Old Sir looks
peeked, Mile. Standin&#8217; so in the door, I saw
a breath o&#8217; feebleness go out again&#8217; him.
Well, stren&#8217;th don&#8217;t hitch up with years.
G&#8217; long there, Danger!&#8221;</p>

<p>The road ran high and lonely over the
ridges. Their eyes, dazzled with leagues of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
white glare, blurred with tears in the sweep
of a freezing wind, gained power slowly to
descry the milder gleam of the channel far
beneath, and beyond this, the billowing of
the Maine hills, softened by distance and
the smoothing magic of the snow. Sometimes,
dipping into a smothered hollow
among firs, they suffered again a momentary
blindness, in the obscurity of dark green
and shadowed white; and again, yet once
more dazed with wide brilliancy, climbed
higher and farther from the river, up an
immense and softly convex curve, toward
the fugitive sky-line. Black evergreen tops,
the distant relics of some grove, dotted the
hill like ermine; or singly, and closer to hand,
like feathered arrows that a giant might have
shot straight downward. Rarely these, however;
so free was the north wind, so shelterless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
and dry the snow, that by turns the sled
groaned over frozen mud, and stuck fast in
smoking drifts.</p>

<p>As the two men pushed and tugged to aid
the horse, or slapped their aching hands,
or stamped and kicked the sled, they exchanged
few words. The slow jangling of
the bells traveled in the void, a stray mote
of cheerful sound.</p>

<p>To Miles, looking back down many a
long slope, they chimed with vague but happy
thoughts. He surveyed, in shining perspective
from this eminence, not only his native
valley, but the last fortnight of his life there.
Ella was wrong, he had not moped; Tony
was wrong, he had hardly considered their
estrangement; here was the real truth: before
that adventure in the fog, he had passed
his days in a brown study, and after it, had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
been whirled into the glowing rout of life.
A hundred dim things which had passed
him by he now saw, heard, felt, and thrillingly
understood.</p>

<p>Two regrets lingered: he had not seen
again either the man or the girl of Alward&#8217;s
Cove; and from them he traveled farther at
every shake of the bells. Yet all that was but
temporary; and meanwhile, to his strange,
new vision of the world, the simplest detail
in this simple journey was a bit of exultation.</p>

<p>The woods at last received them into vast
and crowded silence. The sorrel horse, with
steaming haunches, plodded heavily through
a dark lane of virgin whiteness, between
puffy, undulating banks of buried under-wood.
Beyond or through these, in broken
glimpses of depth, white and black trunks
so lurked and interchanged in reciprocating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
movement as to create an illusion of presences&mdash;many,
yet one&mdash;who dodged and
spied and followed. There seemed no other
life in all this stillness. Yet now and then,
in sunny clearings, a line of tiny hollows,
filled with shadowy blue, marked some late
woodland errand; the straight trot of a fox,
scored alongside with shallow scoops of his
brush; the neat cuneiform written by partridge
claws; the bunched all-fours of a leaping
rabbit, or the beaten stream where his
whole tribe had flowed over log and knoll
into some green cavern. When drifts halted
the sled, and brought the bells to silence
or single notes, an invisible brook chuckled
from among willows, its runnels gossiping
under ice and snow.</p>

<p>At dusk the two men reached a dark little
shanty in second-growth beeches.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>&#8220;W&#8217;oa there, Gyasticus!&#8221; cried Hab.
&#8220;Here y&#8217; are. Stand by to unlo&#8217;d dunnage!&#8221;</p>

<p>That night they spent in watches, turn
about, sleeping and tending fire; and before
daylight were out and away to distant
groves of birch and maple. A week of happy,
vigorous days fled by. Sometimes the two
chopped side by side; sometimes they separated
for whole mornings, each alone in
the snowy wilderness, but for the ringing
shock of the other&#8217;s axe in frosty wood, half
a mile away. The novice felled his trees,
first with reluctance at such treachery to
old friends, but later with a workman&#8217;s pride.
In the beginning they crashed through their
neighbors&#8217; tops in a violent cloud of snow,
dazzling as an explosion of diamond dust;
but now they dropped, groaning, with one
clean swing into their foreseen places.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>At noon Miles met Habakkuk in the lee
of a tall granite boulder, blackened with
smoke, and crowned with the red spikes
of sumac. Here, over a leaping fire, they
boiled snow for their coffee, and thawed
their frozen food; and here they lounged for
a half hour of vernal warmth and drowsiness.
Snow, melted by noonday sun above
and flame beneath, dropped round them
from the branches, in white batons that
broke and dispersed in mid-air. A thin arc
of pale green grass bordered the melting
semicircle where they sat, with steaming
moccasins, while Old-Hab growled some
slow account of &#8220;getting out knees,&#8221; of
swamping, stumpage, the excellence of beech
for &#8220;water-log work,&#8221; and all the personal
traits of Nasty Ellum, Old Popple, and
Master Oak.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>Night found them tired in camp, sleeping
or watching the fire. Once or twice only
they sat together talking.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir, for my years, I stay clever,&#8221; said
Habakkuk, on one of these rare occasions.
Smoking wisely, he pointed his weather-vane
countenance toward the glow. &#8220;Can&#8217;t
leave Old Mundungo alon&#8217;, but never teched
Rum. Result is, spry and tough as linkumvity.
Old-Hab they call me; but that&#8217;s jest
to tell apart from Lazy-Hab. Now me, always
fond o&#8217; work; him, always talkin&#8217; o&#8217;
luck and lookin&#8217; for easy ways. Never could
break that boy to harness. A hard-o&#8217;-hearin&#8217;
man, he is; but eyes like a bee. Always
connivin&#8217; round and spyin&#8217; after truck.
Spoilt a turnip-field, one time, diggin&#8217; for
gold.&#8221;</p>

<p>The teamster chuckled, meditating.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>&#8220;Cap&#8217;n Kidd&#8217;s pirate money, once, he
&#8217;lowed &#8217;twas hid somewheres along ar shore.
To see him, those days, you&#8217;d thought the
price o&#8217; clams had ris&#8217;. And shortly afterwords,
havin&#8217; eyesight like a bee, the young
fool found some kind o&#8217; mound up into a
patch o&#8217; woods. Took spade, pick, and lantrun,
and sneaked up there one night. Old
Postmaster Quinn see his light, and bein&#8217;
always of a busy-brain, followed him after.
Found Lazy-Hab over a dug hole, pryin&#8217;
open a chist full o&#8217; stuff.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;What ye doin&#8217;?&#8217; shouts Quinn. &#8216;Come
away from that!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lazy-Hab, bein&#8217; a hard-o&#8217;-hearin&#8217; man,
kep&#8217; right on. So Quinn claps mouth to ear,
and bellers &#8216;Small-pock!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lazy-Hab give a jump like Sam Patch,
and run, and never stopped for spade or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
lantrun. &#8217;Twas that Portugee sailor&#8217;s kit,
died o&#8217; the small-pock up to Barry&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again the wood-chopper laughed, quietly.</p>

<p>&#8220;All one same,&#8221; he continued, growing
serious, &#8220;that ain&#8217;t sayin&#8217; the Old Sir didn&#8217;t
bury no pirate-money round these parts.&#8221;
He rose suddenly, nodding with an air of
mystery. &#8220;Reminds me. Come along till
I show ye.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bundling himself warmly, and seizing
the lantern, he led Miles outdoors, round
the hut, through the whispering withered
leaves of the stunted beeches, and up a steep
rising ground. Wading thigh-deep, or scrambling
over dry granite, they gained the rocky
summit of a little hill.</p>

<p>&#8220;I see it a fortni&#8217;t ago,&#8221; said Old-Hab.
&#8220;Up here alon&#8217;. P&#8217;r&#8217;aps &#8217;twon&#8217;t show to-night.&#8221;
He pointed across the vast darkness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
of the valley. &#8220;Down there&#8217;s the river,
and my finger&#8217;s &#8217;bout on that bit o&#8217; island
opposite your place. Now from tide-water,
she looks all solid fars and spruce, don&#8217;t
she? But up here, daytimes, they show jest
a ring-round, like, and a bald spot in the middle.
Now, one night&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He bosomed the lantern under his sheepskin
coat. In starlight, they faced a bitter
wind, hearing only the whisper of the beeches
and the distant bark of a fox.</p>

<p>&#8220;Watch! Nothin&#8217;, is they? Well, p&#8217;r&#8217;aps&mdash;Hold
on! See there!&#8221;</p>

<p>Far off and far below, a point of light
gleamed, winked, shone steady for some
minutes, and was gone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jest like other time,&#8221; said Hab. &#8220;Now
what d&#8217; ye make o&#8217; that?&#8221;</p>

<p>Miles, wondering, could find no explanation.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>&#8220;Me neither,&#8221; muttered his companion,
as they descended to the hut. &#8220;Some one
diggin&#8217; for the Old Sir&#8217;s money? I give it
up. Ain&#8217;t pic-nic weather, any rate, jibometer
below. Not tellin&#8217; fo&#8217;ks, but some
loafin&#8217; weather I may take a look there myself&mdash;invest
things, kind of.&#8221;</p>

<p>Without further incident their ten days
drew to a close. Though they climbed the
hill a second time, no light appeared on the
island. Their speculation flagged, and soon
Miles was to forget it, along with other
trifles.</p>

<p>They were returning from a day&#8217;s work
below the hut, and had crossed a long bog
or heath, where the pent-up water of some
brook shone toward the sunset, a broad,
pale mirror of green ice. On the upper side
of this they had gained the road, which ran<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
roundabout with the low, skirting alders,
black against the west,&mdash;a belt of night,
between the last daylight sinking vertically
in the sky and the last daylight horizontally
retreating along the ice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Somebody comin&#8217;,&#8221; said Old-Hab suddenly.
Both men paused and listened.</p>

<p>They heard no bells, but in the extreme
silence of twilight caught a faint jingle of
trace-chains, and the frosty creak of runners,
following Hab&#8217;s own runners in the
ruts of a week ago. Some one drew slowly
nearer, invisible in the black band of night,
but moving as an obscure, watery reflection
along the sallow ice, darkening the thin,
inverted fringe of alders. The picture of that
still approach, long afterward, became for
Miles the symbol and essence of all misgiving.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>A white horse appeared, drawing a swaddled
figure on a sled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hallo!&#8221; called the voice of Tony.</p>

<p>He pulled up, and fixed them with a strange
look, his eyebrows sharply contracted in the
dusk.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that you?&#8221; His tone, though matter
of fact, was subdued and changed. &#8220;Miles,
old chap, I&mdash;They sent me after you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Has&mdash;has anything happened, Tony?&#8221;</p>

<p>The sailor nodded soberly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your grandfather wants to see you.
You&#8217;d better come along.&#8221; He hesitated,
then fell back upon that homely phrase
which trouble has consecrated. &#8220;He&mdash;he&#8217;s
a very sick man, Miles. I&#8217;ll take you.&#8221;</p>

<p>It seemed to Miles that all his life he had
foreseen and known this moment in the
dark woods.</p>

<small>THE COUNCIL</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> house, as they plunged down the last
hill at midnight, showed orange squares
above and below,&mdash;the windows in both
stories, lighted as for some rare festivity.
The sight was unfamiliar and daunting.
So, when the door opened, was the strange
new dignity with which Ella admitted him
and answered his unspoken question.</p>

<p>&#8220;Asleep; restin&#8217; quiet. Cap&#8217;n What&#8217;s-name
here&#8217;ll take Quinn&#8217;s hoss home. Come
get your supper, and then straight to bed.&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/chap6.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>He obeyed, as in a dream. In whispers,
by the yellow lamplight, she forced him to
eat and drink; then led the way upstairs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
As they tiptoed past, the door of the sick-room
stood ajar. Miles peeped in. A shawl
curtained the bed from lamp and firelight,
but even in deep shadow the sleeper&#8217;s face
wore a sinister mask of alteration.</p>

<p>&#8220;To bed now,&#8221; whispered the servant.
&#8220;I&#8217;m settin&#8217; up, Miles.&#8221; She touched his
shoulder gently. &#8220;Come. To-morrow&#8217;ll do.&#8221;</p>

<p>He lay down, fully dressed, and ready
for misfortune. Dozing through the dark
hours, he roused, from time to time, at an
imaginary summons. Weariness conquered,
however, and when he woke Ella stood
watching, from beside a window flooded
with sunshine.</p>

<p>&#8220;He wants to see ye, after breakfast,&#8221;
she said quietly. &#8220;Doctor&#8217;s come and gone
again. I wouldn&#8217;t wake ye, poor dear. No
noos. No change, either way.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>Again, using a forgotten title of childhood,
she compelled him to sit at table:
&#8220;You must keep up, little Cap&#8217;n. Can&#8217;t
have two sick men.&#8221; That new, quiet authority
of hers remained a strange comfort,
even as he mounted the stairs.</p>

<p>His grandfather lay sunken among pillows,
his eyes closed, his features pale, gaunt,
profoundly calm. Of suffering, of life itself,
no more trace appeared than in a carven
effigy of patience. Then quite suddenly
his eyes opened, roved about the room in
feeble search, and, resting on Miles, lighted
dully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, the boy! Come sit by me.&#8221; He
whispered hoarsely, and with slow effort.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve got my orders, haven&#8217;t I? Not long,
my boy, not so very long now.&#8221;</p>

<p>To hear their dread thus put roundly into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
words, aloud, from the man&#8217;s own lips,
seemed at first a tragic impropriety.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, grandfather, no!&#8221; Miles faltered,
without conviction.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221; The old man smiled strangely,
placidly. &#8220;I knew it. Only a bad cold to
start with. I could shake that off&mdash;&#8221; He
stirred impatiently, as if to prove his words,
then sank back in resignation. &#8220;Heart too
weak. I overheard the doctor.&#8221;</p>

<p>Somehow, for the first time in his life,
Miles felt that his grandfather&#8217;s frown was
rather habitual than unkindly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s no great matter, Miles.&#8221; The
voice continued, halting and broken, sometimes
clear, sometimes a whisper. &#8220;So long
as you came time enough&mdash;all right. Now
I want to make my confession. Don&#8217;t you
be too hard on me.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>Crabbed age and youth had lived together,
and lived happily, under fixed conditions
of authority and deference; and now the old
man&#8217;s words, or rather something of anxiety
in his look, appeared to reverse all their
common habits, to set their life-long attitude
topsy-turvy. A judge, severe and just,
present above the young man&#8217;s daily acts,
swaying his blindest motives, had imperceptibly
become an unknown strength and
necessity. To have this strength suddenly
fail, this judgment submit to his own, gave
Miles a forlorn sense of uncertainty, of loneliness.
Independence, that stern, hard-won
privilege, was now granted him without
warning, thrust violently into his heart. And
the same hand which planted this new gift
plucked up thoughts and feelings rooted in
his childhood.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>&#8220;It&#8217;s this sailor, Florio,&#8221; said the old man.
&#8220;He&#8217;s been very heavy on my conscience.
He lied to me, but I could use it, and so I
lied in turn&mdash;to you&mdash;perhaps the whole
neighborhood&mdash;At my age&mdash;It&#8217;s all disgraceful!&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused, and, resting, seemed to cast
about for words.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been very hard with you. Yes&mdash;heavy
load, tight rein. I was&mdash;was afraid
you might slip away. And I want you to
start well&mdash;to go far. You must be something
better than a book-worm, like me&mdash;a
broken-down surveyor of land. Eh? Yes,
better than your father Godfrey, or Christopher;
yes, or my brother George, the Admiral
himself. Perhaps. Look to it.&#8221;</p>

<p>A fit of coughing interrupted him.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sit there. I must talk, anyway,&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
he continued weakly. &#8220;Stand by. Paupers
and poorhouses&mdash;I&#8217;ve always talked those
at you, haven&#8217;t I? Why, boy? Because I
was a miser. We kept lighthouse&mdash;for
money. That doesn&#8217;t matter; but the worst
is&mdash;&#8221; A faint flush had stolen into his
hollow cheeks. &#8220;The worst is, I even kept
this half-breed fellow&mdash;God knows who he
may be; he&#8217;s no friend of Christopher&#8217;s&mdash;I
saw that in the first week, but I took
his money. Hard&mdash;but I hated&mdash;oh yes,
disgusting&mdash;a shame!&#8221;</p>

<p>With a stifled, inarticulate sound, the
speaker paused, and closed his eyes for a
time, then bent them on Miles in a timid
appeal.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miser, that&#8217;s the word. But&mdash;I was
saving everything, good and bad&mdash;saving
for the fund, for your start. I taught you as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
far as I could. Now promise me you&#8217;ll go farther.
Out&mdash;away from here&mdash;the world&mdash;study&mdash;work.
There&#8217;s enough for a year,
perhaps two. All yours&mdash;black and white&mdash;my
box. You must use it well&mdash;came
hard. Say you&#8217;re not ashamed of me!&#8221;</p>

<p>The distance between age and youth, the
mist of self, the vague screen dividing their
daily lives, were annihilated. In sudden
wisdom and contrition, Miles bent his head
beside this man whom he had never known
before.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ashamed?&#8221; he cried, dimly measuring
the sacrifice. &#8220;Ashamed? Oh, grandfather!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, come, then!&#8221; Something of the
testy, hard old voice returned for the instant.
&#8220;Come, then, it&#8217;s all right. What did
the old preacher say, that they burned?
&#8216;It&#8217;s given to no man to choose the time or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
manner of his death.&#8217; Not a case of Nunc
Dimittis, I&#8217;m not allowed to see it through.
What of that? At least&mdash;Call the thing
unfinished&mdash;a man cut down in hot blood&mdash;doesn&#8217;t
feel it&mdash;Only, you must start.
Your half begins. I want you&mdash;take it all.
I never could use fine words!&mdash;Go find what
you&#8217;re good for.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miles nodded, but could not speak. Shame
and wonder contended in him, at thought
of his own blindness all these years: he had
considered his grandfather as a grim, silent
man, preoccupied with gloomy fear of the
future. Revelation had come: the spent runner
now resolutely passed on the torch, and
Miles trembled at his unworthiness to receive
it from such hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;One thing more,&#8221; continued the old
man, stirring uneasily. &#8220;What was this Ella<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
said, t&#8217;other day, about sweethearts, or some
nonsense? Did she mean&mdash;Is there&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; stammered Miles.
The challenge had struck him hot and cold.
The more sincerely he faced it, the more
this question deepened into a yawning pit
of subtleties. &#8220;Honestly&mdash;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t know?&#8221; His grandfather eyed him
almost angrily. &#8220;What sort of answer is
that? See here, I can&#8217;t have&mdash;At your age&mdash;You
must promise me&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>A violent cough seized him, and left him
shaken and breathless. For a long time he
rested, as if asleep. And when at last he
spoke again, a smile of serene humor, of
high forbearance and security, lighted the
sunken eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;You promise nothing, boy. If I had
promised my father&mdash;I&#8217;m an old fool.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
We&#8217;ve agreed to the main thing, already.
It&#8217;s all right. You&#8217;re a man. Give me the&mdash;that
nasty dose, there.&#8221;</p>

<p>He sank back, as though he had reserved
all his forces for their interview, and now
lay exhausted. The ticking of a clock, the
flutter of the fire, accompanied that labored
breathing through slow and sorrowful hours.
The watcher must have dozed; for of a sudden,
the shadows of the hackmatack boughs
quivered easterly along the floor. The afternoon
was already closing. Ella sat, with
folded hands, by the hearth.</p>

<p>Time again dragged by, till the sleeper
moved. Without seeming to wake, he whispered:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t remember. Bring me the book.&#8221;</p>

<p>A Bible lay on the table; but as though
he heard Miles lift it, he shook his head.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>&#8220;I&#8217;ve read that. I know it. The other&mdash;below&mdash;the
black book.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ella nodded, stole from the room, and returned
with the old man&#8217;s volume of the
poets.</p>

<p>&#8220;How does it go? Read to me, Miles.
&#8216;Even so is time&#8217;&mdash;You know it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miles found the page, and with an unsteady
voice obeyed.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<div class="verse">&nbsp; &nbsp;But&mdash;&#8217;&#8221;</div>

<p>The old man stopped him, with a sign
of content, and took up the lines, whispering:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;&#8216;But from this earth, this grave, this dust,</div>

</div></div>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>He lay very still; but when, after a time,
Ella would have offered him something in a
glass, he put her hand feebly aside. Miles
could not hear their words, except, &#8220;If
every one was faithful as you&mdash;&#8221; and the
woman&#8217;s reply, &#8220;I&#8217;ll never leave him till
he sends me away.&#8221; She rose, and, crossing
to the window, where a row of geraniums
glowed in the sunset, stood picking blindly
at the dead leaves.</p>

<p>He continued to speak, but neither audibly
nor with the living. From time to time
they caught the name of George, Godfrey,
or Christopher. His eyes remained closed;
but his face turned slightly, now and then,
with the air of one who clearly saw and
heard the persons in a ghostly conference.
As day drooped into night, the seen fused
with the unseen. And it was in a mystical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
twilight that he turned toward Miles, at last,
with a look of grave relief, which told that
the council had reached some fortunate conclusion.
The lips barely moved, and indeed
the eyes made their effort needless.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m satisfied, my boy.&#8221;</p>

<p>The only praise he had ever given, it was
beyond all value.</p>

<p>The woman lighted a lamp behind the
shawl; then stood beside Miles, waiting.
Nothing moved in the room, except twin
shadows of the andirons fluttering on the
wall, alert and capricious as a pair of fencers.
In the passage Tony the sailor had paused
silently, like a man drawn by strange impulse
to the edge of a forbidden circle.</p>

<p>Something approached, arrived, and culminated.
The counterpane stirred. It was
as though a broad and soothing wave had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
lifted the prostrate figure slightly, and passed,
bearing away the spirit in one gentle, mighty
undulation.</p>

<p>The servant was the first to speak.</p>

<p>&#8220;He was a good man,&#8221; she whispered.
&#8220;It&#8217;s over now. He was a good man.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Within two days Richard Bissant lay beside
his brother, the Admiral, close beneath
a yellow birch that rose in the highest field, a
living monument, a landmark to ships below
in the river. He had taught Miles to believe
that the natural body is raised a spiritual
body, and that this corruptible must put
on incorruption. And though the grave,
cut in frozen earth, and ringed about with
shapeless banks of snow, seemed in those
bleak surroundings to gain more than a
brief victory, yet the survivor, feeling his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
sorrow as a man, could still dispute it like
a man.</p>

<p>One thing, in this time of perplexity, appeared
beyond mistake; and that was Tony&#8217;s
unwonted and unflagging kindness. Silent
in his moccasins, like a sea-gaited Indian,
he had come and gone about the house,
bringing armfuls of firewood, helping Ella,
tending the tower lamps. It was he who ran
all errands to Kilmarnock, and shoveled
the broad path from their door to the birch
tree on the hill. Not only his activity, but
his silence and retirement, had shown a
right spirit, touched honestly. Miles, recalling
his former thoughts, saw them as unjust.
After all, the sailor, like the man who was
now become a memory, had only kept his
own counsel. &#8220;And I blamed him for that!&#8221;
thought Miles, with remorse.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>And yet Tony&#8217;s presence was none the less
disquieting. It had vexed and humbled,
however needlessly, the closing days of a
most honorable life; and Miles, though
wishing to keep the man&#8217;s friendship, rebelled
at thought of using him for profit.
Right or wrong, it was very strongly in his
mind that Tony must either leave or come
to an explanation; for since that conference
in the sick-room, the sailor&#8217;s standing, the
whole arrangement, became more and more
false and intolerable.</p>

<p>Other questions cropped up in their altered
household,&mdash;questions of the past and the
future, jostling in a mind still dazed. And it
was these which, two nights after the burial
on the hill, kept the young man restless. He
lay revolving vague plans, resolutions, regrets,
till at last, foregoing all hope of sleep,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
he rose, dressed in the dark, and stole downstairs
to the little front room which had been
his grandfather&#8217;s &#8220;library.&#8221; A puddle of
ruby coals still glowed in the fireplace; but
before sitting down by these, he turned
toward the gray square of the windows, and
stood looking out through a wide, cosmic
starlight, faint and deceptive, but dimly intensified
by frosty air and the whiteness of
snow. Without speech or language, the
heart of the darkness strengthened the heart
of youth, as above the silent valley night unto
night showed knowledge.</p>

<p>Stillness without grew almost palpable,
through stillness within. The house lay
drowned in sleep. But suddenly Miles heard
a thin, brushing sound upon the landing
above, the squeak of a board, and the dry
rasp of a hand sliding down the banister-rail.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
Some one descended with extreme caution,
and then, below the row of pegs in the dark
corridor, struggled into a jacket, with subdued
fluttering of heavy cloth. The front
door slowly creaked, and, letting chill air
flood the room, as slowly creaked again.</p>

<p>It lacked two hours before time for inspection;
and besides, whoever went to the
towers would carry a lantern. Miles watched.
A dark, thick-set blur moved out under the
starlight and disappeared between the two
hackmatack pillars. Tony the sailor was up
and about his affairs.</p>

<p>Angry and determined, Miles crept along
the passage, drew on his reefer as silently as
the other had done, and slipped outdoors
into the freezing darkness.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br />

<small>HABAKKUK&#8217;S LIGHT</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Stars,</span> frost, and glimmer of snow blended
into a bluish, dim suffusion, a hyperborean
obscurity that was neither light nor darkness.
The figure ahead showed as a blotch
of denser twilight, dissolving, rather than
moving, down the slope. Miles prowled
after, straining his eyes to detect in what
quarter of the black undergrowth it was absorbed
and blotted.</p>

<p>No light, no sound, could either guide or
betray him. His impulse had been to stride
along, to overtake and question the sailor; but
so, reflection told him, he might destroy his
only chance to learn the truth. He waded onward,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
accordingly, with great care; and slipping
through fir branches, gained free footing
in the beaten path. No wind stirred; and
though faint aerial changes drew widely over
the valley, not a bristle whispered among all
the drooping, padded layers of black and
white. With the old expectancy he came to
the buried quarter-deck. No one appeared.</p>

<p>He crossed, and was passing into the evergreen
gap beyond, when he ran solidly
against some person emerging. With an
angry start he grappled the stranger by both
arms. For an instant they wrestled silently.
Wrapped in a long rough ulster or cloak, his
opponent not only struggled at a disadvantage,
but exerted neither weight nor force.
Miles felt a lithe body strain furiously to
escape, and then, after a single spasm of
resistance, unexpectedly surrender. At the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
same moment, as they lurched back against
the yielding support of young boughs, in a
downfall of clotted snow, he felt his cheek
swept at once sharply by fir needles and
softly by disordered hair. In shifting holds,
his bare hand closed tight round a bare
wrist, surprisingly frail and warm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re hurting me!&#8221; complained
the captive in a fierce whisper. &#8220;Let go!&#8221;</p>

<p>Whether at the voice, the contact, or the
recognition, a quick thrill ran through his
fore-arm, like the instant passage of a mysterious
current.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s you!&#8221; Both spoke at once, with the
same manner, the same thought.</p>

<p>Looking for Tony, he had found his companion
of the fog. This surpassing wonder
overwhelmed him. Yet in that flaming instant,
in the very rout of reason, Miles&mdash;where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
a wise man or a fool might have inferred
obviously and ignobly&mdash;saw the facts
with the ease of inspiration.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re out on the same errand,&#8221; he
whispered. &#8220;You&#8217;re looking for your father?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How did&mdash;I can&#8217;t tell you!&#8221; she panted.
&#8220;Let me go! Please, let go!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I forgot.&#8221; He released her, suddenly
confused and awkward. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t mean&mdash;I&mdash;I&#8217;m
sorry.&#8221;</p>

<p>She started as if to pass, then stopped.</p>

<p>&#8220;What did you want him for?&#8221; she asked,
with a strange mingling of timidity and reproach.
&#8220;Why are <i>you</i> after him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not,&#8221; said Miles. &#8220;It&#8217;s your friend
Florio&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My friend!&#8221; she whispered scornfully.
&#8220;Then they <i>are</i> together!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>Through his excitement Miles had become
aware that the sound of oars drew toward
them down river, close to shore. The rowing
stopped, just below; thin ice crackled,
under the feet of some one tramping down
toward the water; and the surly voice of
Abram called from the stream,&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;That you, cap&#8217;n?&#8221;</p>

<p>From the shore Tony answered impatiently:</p>

<p>&#8220;Rather&mdash;with both feet in the mud.
Stir your stumps, don&#8217;t keep me freezing
here!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come&#8217;s fast as I could,&#8221; growled the
other. &#8220;Needn&#8217;t think you&mdash;put on airs!&#8221;</p>

<p>By tacit alliance, Miles and the girl found
themselves leaning on the platform rail, peering
together into the darkness. All below
was invisible, but they heard the boat come
grating to land, the mutter of the voices, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
the hollow, jerky beat of oars departing
quickly, straight out from shore.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on,&#8221; whispered Miles. &#8220;Come
along. Let&#8217;s follow and see!&#8221;</p>

<p>The whim was contagious and inspiring.
Together they scrambled down the snow-bank,
joining hands for the steep slide. At
the bottom Tony&#8217;s boat loomed gray before
them, buried like a knoll. The tarpaulin,
loaded with snow, clung heavy and obstinate;
but Miles ripped it off at last, and slid the
boat gently from the chocks.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dragging it will sound like the mischief,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;Could you manage the bow?&#8221;</p>

<p>Luckily the boat was light, and as they
staggered down the beach, winding among
the black open patches and avoiding the
ice, he felt, with a singular pride, that the
girl held up her end gamely.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>He had allowed the two men a long start,
and still listened, till their oars sounded
feebly across the water.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ready,&#8221; he said at last.</p>

<p>She brushed past him into the stern. He
shoved off, muffled the rowlocks in his
woolen scarf and a boat-mop of frozen jute,
and rowed slowly out, with only a faint creaking,
and the steady trickle from the blades.
Astern, as the shore retreated, the twin lights
drew imperceptibly toward each other. Their
glow left the water in darkness, and, dwindling,
became fixed, lustrous points, as of two
erring planets sunken low, on the wrong
side of the horizon. Out here the river lay
black under the starlight, which, no longer
reflected by the snow, seemed to have raised
and withdrawn aloft. Far ahead the oars
were beating regular as a pulse,&mdash;a dull<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
throbbing that alone disturbed the night,
except when thin peals of untimely cock-crow
sounded, faint as muted horns, from
indoors, across wide distances.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t they seem strange?&#8221; said the girl,
half to herself. &#8220;Like something&mdash;like a
ghost story.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;or the legend,&#8221; answered Miles.
&#8220;And it <i>is</i> drawing on to Christmas
time.&#8221;</p>

<p>A short silence followed, before she asked:</p>

<p>&#8220;What legend?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh&mdash;why, you know it.&#8221; He slowly
recalled the lines, prompted by the pale
mystery of stars overhead, the swerving
profundity of the tide beneath, but more
than all by the whispering, muffled figure
on the thwart, obscure as a shape of
sorcery.</p>

</div></div>

<p>He rowed on steadily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I remember where,&#8221; she said, after
a time. &#8220;They read that to us in school one
winter. It&#8217;s very beautiful. But I can&#8217;t
remember things like you. I wish&mdash;&#8221; She
laughed somewhat bitterly. &#8220;We don&#8217;t have
books in our house&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Though strange, their situation seemed
profoundly simple,&mdash;a sudden, unforeseen,
yet natural welding of present to past adventure.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
They were afloat together, in the
same wide concealment, almost as though
the same obscurity, without interval, had
but changed from white to black. So
welcome was this conjoining magic that,
for the moment, they could forget its
cause.</p>

<p>Suddenly, however, the sound which they
followed came to an end.</p>

<p>&#8220;They heard us,&#8221; whispered the girl.</p>

<p>Miles, with a like thought, stopped rowing.
Still, their voices had been quiet as their
oars. Surely the two men had not&mdash;yet why
should they drift in mid-stream? He pondered,
listening; and then first came the
memory of Habakkuk&#8217;s light, seen from the
high woods.</p>

<p>&#8220;The island. They&#8217;re landing.&#8221; Even as
he whispered they heard, well off their port<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
bow, the crash of splintering beach ice.
&#8220;The lower end.&#8221;</p>

<p>He swung the boat&#8217;s nose up river, and,
yielding to the flood-tide, made for the head
of the island. Gradually the loom of shore
spread round and above them, deepening
the night. As if a shadow had solidified, the
unseen beach grated softly beneath their
bow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sand!&#8221; said Miles. &#8220;A piece of luck.&#8221;</p>

<p>With one hand on his shoulder, she vaulted
lightly ashore. They lifted the boat beyond
reach of tide, climbed a shelving slant that
rose to the foot of the main ledge, and groped
along an impending granite wall, which the
river had deeply gnawed and under-cut, as
cattle ravage a haystack. A cleft, however,
at last gave access; and grasping each other
timorously, struggling together, they gained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
the upper level. Here the north wind had
swept the beak of the island clear; for scrubby
bushes&mdash;lambkill, perhaps, or sweet-fern,
or blueberry&mdash;parted rustling underfoot,
with the frailest odor of dried herbs. Then
evergreens compassed all about, breast-high,
in snow and darkness.</p>

<p>They now waded so heavily in drifts,
through a grove so deeply smothered, that
their venture began to appear both difficult
and harebrained. Its impulse was rapidly
cooling, when a sudden light swung through
the firs ahead, and turned the thicket
into a reel of ponderous shadows, dizzily
whirling upward. This motion ceased.
The snow-fronds gleamed in swollen, billowy
outlines.</p>

<p>Among these the two companions peered.
They had struck through the annular grove<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
of the island, and were looking into the open
centre. A white drift, crested like a wave,
shone behind a lantern set upon bare ground.
Tugging sounds and a click of metal rose
close at hand, behind a screen of boughs. A
man grunted angrily.</p>

<p>&#8220;There, by Godfrey! Told ye so! I bust
the lock!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What odds?&#8221; replied the cheerful voice
of Tony. &#8220;Don&#8217;t need it. Rip it off!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do your own rippin&#8217;! My fingers ain&#8217;t
nobody&#8217;s monkey-wrench.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, they&#8217;d rather pick pockets. Stand
clear, then.&#8221; Something snapped. &#8220;There,
my skulker! Almost took muscle, didn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you call me no names!&#8221; began
Abram loudly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shut your head!&#8221; cried the sailor imperiously.
&#8220;By George, you make a man sick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
with all your nasty blowing. Fill your sack,
and shut up!&#8221;</p>

<p>Silence followed, broken by light thuds in
quick succession. A shadow heaved athwart
the glow, in a thin white cloud of steaming
breath. It was Tony, with some shapeless
burden in his arms.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come along,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>A second shadow rose, and stooped toward
the lantern, grumbling.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t tromp down them rocks no more
&#8217;thout a light.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let it stay!&#8221; roared Tony. &#8220;How many
times must I tell you? We can&#8217;t go showing
lights on that beach. Drop it! You can see
to cross the clearing, and that&#8217;s enough.
Next time, by thunder, you&#8217;ll want me to
carry you!&#8221;</p>

<p>They moved off, growling, round the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
twisted spur of the snow-bank. The night
swallowed them.</p>

<p>Miles gave ample time, before venturing
further; then floundered on through gleaming
undergrowth. The verge, however, rose impassable.
A gigantic drift flung one smooth,
graceful whirl round the little hollow, or
bowl, in which the lantern shone. To break
through would leave a tumbling track of
ruin. The ring stood therefore as good as
enchanted: he could only lean forward and
look.</p>

<p>Close below lay scattered boughs of spruce
or fir; and among these, half uncovered, a
square chest yawned enormous, with lid
thrown back. Full or empty, it showed
nothing inside but darkness.</p>

<p>The return of angry voices sent him dodging
back among the trees. In the interval<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
the quarrel had flamed higher, for at the gap
in the snow Tony wheeled with a savage
flourish.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bother?&#8221; he scoffed. &#8220;You&#8217;re the only
bother I see!&#8221;</p>

<p>They swung nearer, and even by the smoky
lantern, their faces shone red and threatening.</p>

<p>&#8220;And damned if I&#8217;ll have it, either!&#8221; added
Florio.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no, &#8217;tain&#8217;t no bother,&#8221; sneered his
follower. &#8220;Not a mite! Reg&#8217;lar summer
weather, ain&#8217;t it, to be rowin&#8217; round in? No
bother to git froze, or break your laigs again&#8217;
rocks in the dark, or handle all that pesky
stuff twice over! Usin&#8217; this island was a fool
idee, from the start. No bother! When ye
could kerry it all to oncet, single lo&#8217;ds, slap
over to the furder shore!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Slap over!&#8221; mocked the sailor. &#8220;You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
know, and none better, it&#8217;s not every night
Graves can take it off our hands. Meantime,
what? Stow it in our pockets? or use
what sense God gives geese!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep it on our own side,&#8221; grunted Abram,
&#8220;till Graves gits ready.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a wonder!&#8221; The sailor dashed
his empty sack on the ground passionately.
&#8220;A fair wonder! I was in luck when I got
you! Our own side! Where? Under the bed
or up the chimney? Between that girl at
your house and young Bissant at mine, how
long would it stay hid? What&#8217;s that? Outdoors?
Good Lord! did it ever cross your
mind that snow leaves tracks? Look behind
you, and see the path we&#8217;ve beaten! But no
one comes out here; and that&#8217;s why, idiot!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Old man Bissant would &#8217;a&#8217; took it in,&#8221;
retorted the mutineer. &#8220;Jest give him some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
money, let him into cahoots, and he&#8217;d &#8217;a&#8217;
kep&#8217; still.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two men faced each other closely,
scowling above the light. Raging and voluble,
Tony had spoken with more and more
odd turns of voice and gesture, as though
anger stirred his blood to a southern heat.
Now he stepped forward quickly, and, half
crouching, shook his raised fingers at arm&#8217;s
length, with all the intensity of a Latin.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Via, via!</i>&#8221; he cried. &#8220;You speak so of
the dead! You&mdash;you scut! Never in a thousand
years you would understand such a
man! Say so again, and I knock off your
head!&#8221;</p>

<p>The Yankee recoiled, but spat out intolerable
filth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ye don&#8217;t bully me!&#8221; he snarled. &#8220;You
big-bugs is no better&#8217;n the rest of us&mdash;him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
nor you! All knows he was a skinflint, an
old&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Both figures suddenly reeled past the
lantern, a tangled silhouette, which broke
apart at the hard, quick slap of an open palm.
Abram fell staggering, but sprang back as
on the rebound. Something flashed in his
hand. The two shapes joined again, struggling,
with grunts and curses. In the same
instant Miles felt himself shoved aside, and
recovered barely in time to seize his companion&#8217;s
cloak and thrust her back. She would
have rushed in straightway. He plunged
forward himself, but as quickly halted.</p>

<p>The smaller of the combatants had shot
clear of the ground, and landed with a hollow
shock against the chest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Knives, would you?&#8221; panted the sailor.
&#8220;You came to the right shop!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>He stooped, placed his foot on the blade,
which he snapped in one powerful wrench;
then rising, tossed the haft away, and spoke
as cool and scornful as any Saxon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Next time try steel, not a piece of tin.&#8221;
His breath streamed white before him, as
he added, in a voice of meditation, &#8220;I
don&#8217;t see yet what stopped me driving it
into you. You&#8217;ve that girl to look out for.
Huh! Poor thing! But to tell the truth, I
never thought of that. Just luck, I suppose.
Thank your stars, it&#8217;s only your nose that&#8217;s
bleeding.&#8221;</p>

<p>The fallen man, concealed below the bank,
whimpered and snuffled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, come, brace up,&#8221; advised his
master. &#8220;You&#8217;re well out of a scrape,
Abe. I didn&#8217;t see you were fighting
drunk.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>He bent again, this time as if to ransack
the chest.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll carry what&#8217;s left, and do the rowing.
You can sit still, and think it over.&#8221;</p>

<p>A growl was the only answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t bear malice,&#8221; Tony protested
lightly. &#8220;Can&#8217;t afford that. Better stay by
me. Where else would the money come from?
That&#8217;s the talk, up and doing! You&#8217;re all
right. Now, then, dowse your lantern, and
carry on.&#8221;</p>

<p>Darkness fell. The dry crunch of moccasins
on frosty snow passed away into silence.</p>

<p>Miles, aching and benumbed, still waited
to hear their oars, then ploughed through
into the deserted clearing. Beside him
stooped the girl, as they tossed aside the
loose boughs from the cache. When at last
their mittens slid over a glossy surface, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
struck a match. The tiny flare revealed a
broad lid of polished yellow wood, the corners
capped with brass, and a curious, foreign
padlock hanging broken on the staple.
He saw all this, and yet, even while he threw
open the chest, saw more keenly the face
above his shoulder,&mdash;the pure oval of her
cheeks, her large eyes shining from the black
shelter of a hood.</p>

<p>The first match went out. His second and
last lighted the whole depth of the chest, and
showed it empty. A faint, persuasive odor
lingered within, exotic, alien to the winter
air, new to their experience.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; she whispered.</p>

<p>He shook his head, and dropped the burning
splinter.</p>

<p>&#8220;But what are they doing?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not sure,&#8221; he answered slowly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
&#8220;Nothing that need worry you. Some secret.
Come. They&#8217;re going clear across the river.
We can be home before them.&#8221;</p>

<p>In starlight they heaped the boughs once
more, waded through the belt of firs, and
clambered down, hand in hand, toward the
beach. All the way to their own shore, and
all along the evergreen path from the quarter-deck
to Alward&#8217;s, a strange silence held them
apart. With few words or none, they reached
her door; only on the dark threshold she
turned to speak, and then, as it seemed, resentfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t like you,&#8221; she said; and before
he could frame a question, &#8220;Why, not to
tell me what you really think. That was
what I liked about you.&#8221;</p>

<p>He gave thought to his reply:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;How can I tell you till I&#8217;m certain?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
That wouldn&#8217;t be fair&mdash;to any of us. It&#8217;s
nothing serious.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you believe that&mdash;&#8221; Her manner
changed. &#8220;I suppose you&#8217;re right. But when
you&#8217;re certain, will you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; he promised. &#8220;The first
minute I&#8217;m sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>She made an impulsive movement. The
darkness had thinned insensibly, yet enough
to show her hand outstretched. He clasped
it, both for good-by and for the compact.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">That</span> compact, as Miles stood waiting before
the library fire, seemed reward enough,
not only for their lesser troubles of last night,
but for whatever might come, of greater.
The words, the clasp of hands, the whole
twilight scene, still occupied his thoughts so
busily that when the latch clicked and Tony
entered, he had formed no plan for the expected
interview.</p>

<p>&#8220;Morning,&#8221; called the sailor. Fresh and
hearty as though he had slept all night, he
wore somehow a thoughtful aspect; and his
first movement was toward the window,
where he paused to study the chessmen.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
They stood as Richard Bissant had left them,
but now, touched by winter sunshine, formed
a little plot of brightness, thick-set, like white
and scarlet hyacinths.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;d have won that time.&#8221; Tony shook
his head, musing. &#8220;Yes, if&mdash;A losing game
we play, though, in this world, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;
Again he shook his head, adding inconsequently,
&#8220;One point, Miles: be happy while
you&#8217;re young.&#8221;</p>

<p>His left side brushed a corner of the bookshelf.
He winced, and nursed his arm, which
moved clumsily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lame there,&#8221; he explained, without turning.
&#8220;I stumbled last night, and hit her a
clip.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On our friend&#8217;s knife?&#8221; suggested Miles.</p>

<p>Tony whipped about with a droll face of
consternation.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>&#8220;That fool been blabbing already?&#8221; he
cried. &#8220;He can&#8217;t be out of bed yet!&#8221;</p>

<p>Miles laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, Tony,&#8221; he said quietly. &#8220;We
must have a talk. We should have had, long
before.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You beat me!&#8221; Although Tony chuckled
and flung himself into the armchair carelessly,
the light in his large gray eyes twinkled
hard and wary. &#8220;I&#8217;m sharp in a way,
but you big, long, quiet chaps&mdash;Humph!
What is it? Carry on!&#8221;</p>

<p>Miles came readily to the point.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was on the island last night,&#8221; he began,
&#8220;saw all your squabble there, and looked
into your chest afterward. So I&#8217;ll own up
to eavesdropping, if you will to smuggling.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sailor gave a short laugh, either scornful
or temporizing.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>&#8220;What?&#8221; he asked, as though rather
amused than offended. &#8220;Smuggling what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t matter,&#8221; answered Miles.
&#8220;That&#8217;s your affair. I don&#8217;t know, and don&#8217;t
want to. If it&#8217;s to go on&mdash;&#8221; He faltered,
but spoke warmly, remembering the quarrel
and Tony&#8217;s outburst of generous anger.
&#8220;One thing certain. If it&#8217;s to go on&mdash;I
like you better than ever, Tony, but&mdash;you
can&#8217;t keep this house for headquarters.&#8221;</p>

<p>In high good humor, Tony rapped out an
oath and hammered the arm of his chair.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re the sort,&#8221; he laughed, his teeth
flashing white, his eyes brimming with jovial
admiration. &#8220;Might have known how you&#8217;d
take it. By the Lord, there&#8217;s no tattle-tale
blood in you! You&#8217;ll do, buster! Chuck me
out, but stay friends. That the idea? Right
you are! And devilish sorry I&#8217;ll be to go.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>By one of his sudden changes, his face,
without darkening, fell entirely serious.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know, I never saw before&mdash;&#8221;
He pointed his pipe-stem up at the sombre
canvas above the mantel. &#8220;The old Commander
there&mdash;he looks ready to reef,
steer, crack a man&#8217;s head, or fire a broadside.
Good old days, those. Never saw before you
looked so much alike. But you must take
more on the mother&#8217;s side.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe,&#8221; replied Miles, wondering.</p>

<p>Tony studied them by turns,&mdash;the bold,
severe face of Hardy&#8217;s captain in the picture,
the living face below.</p>

<p>&#8220;Head o&#8217; the family,&#8221; he said at last.
&#8220;Must be damned odd. All <i>my</i> life, now&mdash;If
I hadn&#8217;t run loose&mdash;Strict ideas, strict
ideas! Well, what&#8217;s the odds? I was only
going to say, Miles, you&#8217;ve grown up. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
last week&mdash;that&#8217;s it: you&#8217;ve grown up.&#8221;
He rose, with an air of dejection. &#8220;You&#8217;re
right, too, old chap. I understand. I must
clear out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll miss you, Tony,&#8221; Miles began.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ye-es?&#8221; drawled the wanderer absently.
Forcing a doubtful smile, he surveyed the
room. &#8220;The time I&#8217;ve laid up here&mdash;Talk
of eye-openers! What a rum thing it is, after
all&mdash;a home!&#8221;</p>

<p>After this it was Miles who proposed delay,
and Tony who would not listen.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he repeated. &#8220;You struck it, first
time. Quit the game or move out. That&#8217;s
all fair and square. If I didn&#8217;t stand to win
or lose&mdash;a good slice, too&mdash;why, I&#8217;d say
quit. No! Finish! Come on, old boy, help
lug my box downstairs!&#8221;</p>

<p>And with the box in the stern of his boat,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
he shoved off from shore that very afternoon.
He had shipped oars, and stretched forward
his powerful arms for the first stroke, when
suddenly he tossed back a startling farewell.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll come see you, Miles,&#8221; he laughed.
&#8220;Better not return it, though. Abe might
not understand; and the drunken blighter
gives me trouble enough already.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; called Miles, with a strange misgiving.
&#8220;You mean&mdash;You&#8217;re not going to
Kilmarnock?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Kilmarnock!&#8221; retorted Florio. &#8220;And
have that fat fool Quinn talk me inside out to
the whole village? No fear&mdash;You needn&#8217;t
look so glum, though. Alward&#8217;s won&#8217;t be
bad, for a poor exile. Why, there&#8217;s a girl
there that&mdash;&#8221; He grinned, wagged his head
with a most rascally whistle, squared his great
shoulders, and then, favoring the wounded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
fore-arm, rowed out to swing against the
current.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cheer up, Commander!&#8221; he shouted
from the distance. &#8220;Don&#8217;t forget, we stay
friends!&#8221;</p>

<p>Gloomily enough, however, the young master
of the shore returned alone among his
hummocks, and climbed his glittering winter
field. &#8220;I&#8217;ve made a mess of it,&#8221; he thought
miserably. They were now two in the house
who had been four. Yet as numbers are not
presences, the life within had abated, not
merely by half, or more than half, but by an
immeasurable void. Nor did the greater loss
include the smaller; for in like disproportion
Miles missed his friend the adventurer, at
once, and afterward, more searchingly than he
expected. Smuggling he could regard with all
the tolerance of a borderer; so that as vacant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
days followed lengthening toward spring,
he came sometimes to feel that he had banished
a live companion for a dead scruple.
In the contrary mood&mdash;and this was no
less dismal&mdash;he saw plainly what a dangerous
spirit he had quartered on his best ally.</p>

<p>His promise to her, meantime, went by default;
till on a snowbound morning of more
than usual loneliness, he set aside Tony&#8217;s
wish, buckled on his snowshoes, rounded
the headland to Alward&#8217;s, and knocked at
her door. Little good, however, came of this
expedition. Abram, scowling, blocked his
entrance. He caught a glimpse into a small
room, bare, but surprisingly neat, from the
unseen corner of which came a familiar voice,
saying, with the comfortable inflection of a
man thoroughly at home, &#8220;You know, Anna,
a girl like you&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>The very voice that Tony could use for
making friends; and now, heard only, unqualified
by look or gesture, it somehow rang
not so true. Instantly, however, it broke off.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s up?&#8221; called Tony, and heaved
through the doorway.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s you!&#8221; he said coldly. &#8220;Hold on,
I&#8217;ll come with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>They went back together along the shore,
plodding side by side, but talking at random,
with constraint; and when they parted at the
upper tower, it was on vague though evident
terms of division.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do all the neighboring.&#8221; Tony spoke
sulkily as a boy. &#8220;Thought I asked you not
to come?&#8221;</p>

<p>After this ripple of incident, the winter days
once more fell stagnant, or at the best, moved
on sluggish and imperceptible. Rain came at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
last, however, and thaws, and warm sea fogs
devouring the snow more silently than either,
and more swiftly. Then one by one, like spies
of Nature stealing into the land, followed
the slow and potent changes, yearly forgotten,
yearly striking to the core of remembrance
and delight. Hushing sounds of water rose
from the gullies on still mornings; brown
knolls, from day to day, heaved and widened;
the ice moved out to sea, a white and broken
flotilla, while the river cleared again to shining
blue; snow forsook the hills, forsook the
shore, and clung raggedly under the cedars in
thick, worn plates of ice. Then, too, the earliest
fly woke buzzing in the southern window,
and at noon the house, with door swung wide,
stood open to all the reviving sounds and
nameless stirrings of the valley. Now and
again, a stray cow gamboled ridiculously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
down the field, her bell clanking, her shoulder
bearing a leathern scar where, all winter long,
she had chafed her stanchion. And over the
graves, the birch grew blurred above the hill.</p>

<p>In all this time the outcast made no attempt
at his &#8220;neighboring;&#8221; and Miles, without
understanding, accepted their alienation.
Even pride, however, could not keep him from
being lonely,&mdash;more than ever lonely, in
these mild days and nights of spring. He
wandered by himself, framing and rejecting
plans, no less discontented with the present
than sorely puzzled by the future.</p>

<p>One afternoon, when he had taken these
perplexities for another airing, he fell as it
were into an April daydream by the river,
leaning both elbows on the quarter-deck rail.
Along the verge, and scattered among the
rotten planks, peeped the russet tops of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
young fiddle-head ferns, which to his brooding
eyes seemed almost visibly to uncurl, as
a kitten&#8217;s paws uncurl, intense with drowsy
and voluptuous life. Pale blades of grass
were tenderly thrusting upward from edges
of the warm rocks. And yet a damp scent
of last year&#8217;s leaves, that perished slowly
in the hollows, sternly and wholesomely
reminded him how the world cherishes to
destroy, and destroys to cherish infinitely.
Solemnity closed down upon him, while still
a kind of beatific spell ran through his veins.
For a long time, and for no cause, he recalled
only the winter night when they had leaned
together on the rail, watching.</p>

<p>By strong effort, at last, he denied this
memory, repulsed this longing, and cleared
the decks of his mind.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must go away.&#8221; He fell back on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
promise doggedly. And the thought was
like lead in his shoes, that once would have
winged them. &#8220;As quick as summer comes,
and Ella can tend lamps, I&#8217;m off. That&#8217;s
the plain course&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Voices were coming, at the first sound of
which he sprang upright. Through the
evergreen wall pierced the quick utterance
of Tony, angrily imploring.</p>

<p>&#8220;Treat me this way, like dirt?&#8221; he was
urging. &#8220;And all because a fellow likes you,
and tells you so? Honestly, I mean it,
Anna. And what right have I given you to
think&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Right!&#8221; The girl&#8217;s voice also trembled,
but as though with helpless fury. &#8220;What
right have <i>you</i> to hunt and drive me like&mdash;like&mdash;Oh!
And I was coming here just to
be rid of you!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>&#8220;You can&#8217;t, my dear,&#8221; said the other,
cajoling. &#8220;You can&#8217;t, and that&#8217;s a fact.
Come now&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>A cry echoed among the evergreens as in
an empty room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go back, I hate the sight of you! Go
back and let me alone! I wish I was a man,
to kill you!&#8221;</p>

<p>Miles had sprung to the path among the
firs. It widened before him into a little alley
of green shadows, where the girl stood facing
Tony, her hand raised to strike. As Miles
broke through upon them, she wheeled with
the same look, the same cry, as when he had
rowed out to her in the fog. The sailor fell
back. The malignant flush that darkened his
face was new and ugly; and yet in his eyes
a conflicting change, still more new and
lighted with a saving honesty, continued to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
blaze. If his anger were black as smoke,
through it flickered some higher emotion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hiding in the bushes?&#8221; he sneered. &#8220;You
seem fond of that.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miles found himself unexpectedly at high
tension.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s my own shore!&#8221; he cried, choking.
&#8220;You be off!&#8221;</p>

<p>He had run in close. They seemed on the
point of clinching, when the girl darted between
them, and with a swiftness that had
the effect of strength, caught Miles by the
arm, and flung Tony staggering backwards.</p>

<p>&#8220;For shame!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;Like a pair of
wild savages! I&#8217;m ashamed of you both!&#8221;
From under the high arched brows, her eyes
sent out a dangerous light. She turned but
the one shaft at Tony. &#8220;You go!&#8221;</p>

<p>He stood his ground, and retorted bitterly:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>&#8220;Oh, I see. There <i>is</i> something between
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; She dropped the arm that she had
clung to. And at the word or the movement,
Miles understood, with a strange triumph,
his late repulse from Alward&#8217;s Cove.
&#8220;No, there&#8217;s nothing. But there&#8217;s one thing,
Captain Florio. This man&#8217;s real, and I believe
him clear through. And the way I
believe you is just skin-deep, and the rest all
hollow!&#8221;</p>

<p>Tony made a little plausible gesture of
submission, as foreign as it was graceful.</p>

<p>&#8220;Short and sweet, that is,&#8221; he answered.
&#8220;Not true, all the same. I&#8217;m honest my
own way, if I don&#8217;t parade it like a God&#8217;s
miracle. I meant all I said, Anna; it&#8217;s a
pity you can&#8217;t take it so.&#8221;</p>

<p>He turned away, a jaunty penitent, swung<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
his wide shoulders edgewise into the gap,
and disappeared among the firs. The whisking
of the boughs died into silence; and next
moment the girl&#8217;s courage had fallen slack.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, what shall I do?&#8221; she whispered,
as if alone. Her face she held averted; but
Miles could see her head shaken like a daffodil
on the stalk, and feel the hand tremble
which had caught his arm again. &#8220;Where
can I go? And it&#8217;s in the same house with
me&mdash;They&#8217;re always there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Anna,&#8221; he ventured; and as her hand
dropped suddenly, &#8220;Haven&#8217;t I as good a
right to call you so? Come, we&#8217;re old
friends. Tell us.&#8221;</p>

<p>She would not turn.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s&mdash;oh, it&#8217;s nothing!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If it should be anything?&#8221; he persisted.
&#8220;If you&mdash;won&#8217;t you come tell me then?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>She looked up and away in a flash; but
he had caught the lustre of brimming eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s nobody else I could&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; he cried in a whirl. &#8220;To hear you
say that&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Footsteps crossed the quarter-deck, and
scuffed in the path behind them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello! Ex-scuse me!&#8221; called a hearty
though nasal voice. Like an aged Puck out
of the bushes, Hab the teamster peered
shiftily into their cover. The girl was away
like a fawn.</p>

<p>The teamster&#8217;s head remained as though
he were imbedded in the evergreens.
Wagging it, he broke into batrachian
song:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<div class="verse">&nbsp; Was a ship&#8217;s carpenteer!&#8221;</div>
</div></div>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t think it of ye, Mile,&#8221; he added
mournfully, then winked. &#8220;Ella stated you
was down here. But she don&#8217;t figger what
was up, and bless ye, I&#8217;ll never give it
away.&#8221; He looked behind him, called
&#8220;Here he is, Mr. Furfey,&#8221; and entered the
lane.</p>

<p>A stranger followed him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, Mile,&#8221; continued Habakkuk, with
a flourish. &#8220;This feller&#8217;s the gentleman
I drove all the ways down here to interduce,
name of Furfey.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a brisk, insignificant person who
stepped forward, a smirking little man,
half shabby and half prosperous, plainly
an American, but not of the countryside.
His interruption had thrown Miles into a
passion of disappointment; yet even a more
fortunate arrival might not have helped the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
man. His hand was too moist and loose,
his pale face too shrewdly wrinkled, and his
smile, like the cold stare of his bulbous blue
eyes, too calculating; even his trite compliments
seemed a piece of insinuation. Altogether,
Miles disliked him on sight, as one
dislikes a grub or an earwig.</p>

<p>They returned together to the deck, where
Old-Hab left them to confer. For some time
the stranger made little use of his chance,
but though all too ready and familiar, chattered
and questioned trivially, with a studied
inconsequence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come,&#8221; Miles broke in at last impatiently.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t see yet. Please tell me what I can
do for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man became very confidential.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be frank with you,&#8221; he promised
glibly. &#8220;We&#8217;ll come square to it. Ain&#8217;t that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
right? I may have dealin&#8217;s with a man over
here, likely&mdash;man named Florio. Now,
you&#8217;re so high spoke of all round, I store by
your opinion. See? So I come to you, like
this, and says,&mdash;between us, mind,&mdash;what
d&#8217; ye think about him?&#8221;</p>

<p>Miles considered. From the first mention,
he vaguely saw trouble ahead for Tony;
then, not at all vaguely, saw how that trouble
might at least send Tony packing. The
sooner the happier; toward just such a riddance
his wishes ran like fire. To speak the
mere truth, to aid the law: and in the same
thought he stood confounded at his own baseness.
The loyalty might all be on one side,
yet&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Better see Florio yourself,&#8221; he answered.
&#8220;You can judge. He lives up in the next
cove.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>The stranger argued long, and surrendered
reluctantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he sighed, &#8220;I s&#8217;pose that&#8217;s right,
if you&#8217;re so stubborn to it. I&#8217;ll go see
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>He slouched away, and plunged among the
bushes. Miles, climbing toward the house,
paused halfway on the slope, to look down
thoughtfully at the shore. Seldom had he
encountered so many persons there in one
day; never so many problems. Life, like
the fiddle-heads, seemed to unfold into complexities.
The river sparkled through chinks
in the grove, and dazzled broadly across a
distant gap, where the path swung bare to
the headland. It was the one pass to Alward&#8217;s.
But the stranger did not darken it, either
going or coming.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll wait down there,&#8221; thought Miles,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
&#8220;then come lying back, and say he can&#8217;t
find Tony. Spying! And I couldn&#8217;t tell
him!&#8221;</p>

<p>He could not, the fact was adamant&mdash;not
even to save the hostage in the other camp.</p>

<small>THE RUNNING BROOK</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Some</span> weeks later, at dusk on a calm evening,
Miles and his sole companion sat outdoors for
the first time that year. A little bench&mdash;Tony&#8217;s
handiwork&mdash;girdled the hackmatack,
so that while leaning against the same
trunk, each saw a different quarter of the
valley, and talked over the shoulder lazily,
facing two cardinal points, with thoughts
as far asunder. The time was neither spring
nor summer, but that rare Arcadian interval,
too brief for a season, too elusive for even a
transition, and yet in the calendar of sense
marked off as plain as a festival. The night
fell neither warm nor cool; a tempered fragrance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
of blossoms drew down, without stir
of air, from the orchard over the hill; lower
field and shore, river and farthest ridge, lay
confounded in blackness under the stars,
land and water parted only by faint zigzag
margins, where the last edge of daylight lined
some inlet or hooked about a promontory.</p>

<p>&#8220;Them days,&#8221; continued Ella in a distant
monotone, &#8220;the Injuns camped in back of
ar house at Sweet Water. Old Lewie Neptune,
he was chieft. An&#8217; nights he got drunk,
he&#8217;d pitch &#8217;em outdoor, so&#8217;s all hands would
come beg for in. Midnight an&#8217; bitter cold,
sometimes, women-fo&#8217;ks an&#8217; youngsters, they
rout us out o&#8217; bed. Big Mary, Æneas
Moon an&#8217; his brother Peter, an&#8217; Lolas an&#8217;
Francises an&#8217; Socabasins,&mdash;whol&#8217; slews of
&#8217;em, all wropped an&#8217; huddledt up in blankets,
scairt, an&#8217; sayin&#8217; they&#8217;d be killed. I see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
the kitchen floor covered with &#8217;em, many
the time, sleepin&#8217; curled round the stove&mdash;Who&#8217;s
that?&#8221;</p>

<p>A flurry of footsteps came up out of the
dark; some one raced by them toward the
house.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re out here,&#8221; called Miles, rising.
&#8220;What&#8217;s wanted?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; The runner stopped, and returned
panting. &#8220;I&#8217;ve come. You told me to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Anna!&#8221; he cried joyfully.</p>

<p>She stood for an instant motionless, breathing
hard; gave a little failure of a laugh;
then spoke quickly, in a voice meant to be
calm.</p>

<p>&#8220;I stood them as long as I could. Now
you must tell me where to go. Those men!
While my father stayed himself, I had somebody;
but now he&#8217;s&mdash;they&#8217;re both against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
me.&#8221; She broke off, as though stifled. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
never go back; I won&#8217;t, I won&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>

<p>Ella suddenly moved between them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come in the house,&#8221; she ordered coldly.
&#8220;Can&#8217;t see ye. If the&#8217; &#8217;s trouble, we&#8217;ll take
a light to it, first thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>They went in together to the front room.
Miles lighted the candle (which, since Tony&#8217;s
day, replaced the lamp) and over the trembling
leaf-point of flame saw the girl&#8217;s head
start into radiance like a vision. She stood
before them with a half-shy, half-defiant composure;
but her eyes and her brown cheeks
told another story, a pulse throbbed in her
bare throat, and under the thin blue cloth her
breathing fluttered deeply.</p>

<p>&#8220;He tried to beat me,&#8221; she said, with the
same quiet scorn. &#8220;Me, after all the time I
was&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>Ella had stood watching with eyes puckered
skeptically, and round face set in lines of no
compromise. But now, without warning, she
flung both her stout arms round the refugee.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wild Injuns!&#8221; she fumed. &#8220;What was
I tellin&#8217; ye? You&#8217;re all alike, you men-fo&#8217;ks.
There, there, poor thing!&#8221; Awkward and
motherly, she stroked the girl&#8217;s bright hair,
scolding and consoling in a breath. &#8220;There,
there, nubbin, you&#8217;re all of a quiver&mdash;all
on a string. Worse &#8217;n old Neptune, they
are!&mdash;Miles, I left my knittin&#8217; somewheres
by that tree. Jest you hyper out an&#8217; find it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Needles and all, it lay on the table before
them, but Miles obeyed. He paced back and
forth under the stars, watching the lighted
window. He should be sorry for her, ran
his thought. But his one clear emotion was
nothing of the kind; buoyantly, against reason<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
and through suspense, rioted the conviction
that all was well. When the voices
ceased within, he entered, and found the
two women sitting like friends agreed. They
smiled at him rather uncertainly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; exclaimed the elder, whipping a
handkerchief out of sight. &#8220;That&#8217;s settled,
anyhow. She&#8217;ll stay here with us till she
finds somewheres better.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I forgot,&#8221; the girl objected. &#8220;All
my things are there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll get them,&#8221; offered Miles.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d look well,&#8221; the servant retorted
grimly. &#8220;I&#8217;ll go my own self. Incidental,
I&#8217;ll see that pair o&#8217; shoats. And they won&#8217;t
ask me to set and come again, either!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; said the girl, &#8220;they&#8217;ll come after
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let &#8217;em!&#8221; cried Ella, with sudden extravagance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
&#8220;I&#8217;ll set &#8217;em down so hard they&mdash;they
can comb their hair with their spinal
columes! Let &#8217;em come.&#8221;</p>

<p>For that night no one accepted the challenge;
and next morning Ella promptly descended
on Alward&#8217;s, to return in ferocious
triumph, bearing a little armful of spoils.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s your clothes!&#8221; she cried with the
voice of Deborah. &#8220;A haley old mess that
house is already, without ye! What did I
say to &#8217;em? Never you mind. They know
more &#8217;n they did. The fear o&#8217; the Lord&#8217;s
the beginnin&#8217; o&#8217; wisdom. I said what was
vouched to me that hour. I bit a piece out
o&#8217; the roof!&#8221;</p>

<p>At all events she had determined the situation,
and from now forward there were
three in the house. It seemed incredible.
Miles passed the first days in a dream, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
revolution of thoughts and habits. To have
this shining guest come and go upon the
stairs, or sit at table like a mortal, or read
beside the window on rainy afternoons, or
move at night overhead in Tony&#8217;s chamber,
not only threw all indoor routine into
the bright confusion of drama, but changed
the very air upon the hills, the light on the
waters. The valley was visited, like the plains
of Mamre.</p>

<p>And even when this earliest wonder passed,
and they began to live as though always under
the same roof, he could not find the old bearings.
The change had scattered, tossed, and
revived his faculties, as haymakers pitch a
mouldy windrow abroad in the sun. By an
odd transfer, she who rightfully should radiate
all that was new and strange, had slipped
at once into customary life, established,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
familiar, like a thing of childhood; and when
they walked the shore, dug in the garden side
by side, or tended lamps in the early evening,
it was she who always had belonged there:
all other things&mdash;trees he had seen grow,
rocks he knew in every line and fissure,
paths he could follow running in the dark&mdash;had
altered as after long absence or some
new gift of sight.</p>

<p>It was a happy, incomprehensible time;
none the less happy, although he felt somehow
that vague elements were weaving into
danger, that an unknown thread guided them
in a maze. Perhaps it was only that their
delight would keep no even level, but daily
mounted; perhaps that in their simplest
talk, when their friendship seemed the oldest,
there fell a silence, a chance word, a shock
of difference or agreement, a flash of bygone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
things, to show how unerringly their lines
converged, across what gulfs.</p>

<p>One afternoon, when summer had glowed
and ripened, they revisited Kilmarnock Brook.
Alders flanked the bend through a long
meadow, mapping it distantly as a curved
wall of darker green, and losing it, to near
approach, in a cool, low wood where grassy
clearings wound so intricately that a stranger
(unless he made the one plunge through
tangle) might wander among leaves, see the
oozy light quivering over them from below,
and hear the invisible water sing like a stream
of Tantalus. But Anna and Miles knew all
these interlocked recesses, and, threading them
in and out, had reached their own secret
place,&mdash;an alder closet, where a tiny crescent
of lawn curved round a pool. On a bank which
ran smoothly into brown water, they sat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
a little apart, in shadow. Above them sunlight
dappled the leaves, and day-flies danced
in brief ecstasy; below, with a delicate breath
of steeping earth and roots and brookmint,
the water stole away silently, to take up its
tinkling narrative round the next bend.</p>

<p>For a long time neither had spoken. Suddenly
Miles laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ophelia!&#8221;</p>

<p>She was looking past her open book, considering
the pool.</p>

<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t call names,&#8221; she replied,
without rousing. &#8220;Besides, I don&#8217;t know
what you mean.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Read on this book!&#8217;&#8221; he scoffed. &#8220;The
old chucklehead knew! No girl would ever
read <i>in</i> one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A lot you know about them!&#8221; She
laughed at him, with a sidelong glance, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
quickly returned to her contemplation. &#8220;I
was thinking.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>

<p>She shook her head. A leaf-pattern of
shadows and golden flame settled once more
upon it, trembling.</p>

<p>&#8220;The river-drivers,&#8221; she answered at last.
&#8220;I was only thinking about the river-drivers.&#8221;</p>

<p>Following her glance, he tried, as he had
so often tried in the last weeks, to see with
her eyes. The peace of the pool beside them,
like all peace in Nature, was an illusion.
Minnows steered over the brown sand, or
whipped their magnified shadows, blurred
and globular, through sunny patches under
the farther bank; even where the water lay
most dark and thick, weeds tugged slowly
at the tether; and over the surface her &#8220;river-drivers,&#8221;
snapping and kicking between wind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
and water, floated erratically down an imperceptible
current.</p>

<p>&#8220;About those?&#8221; he asked incredulously.
&#8220;What, those beetles?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221; Her eyes danced with that look
of hers which he had never seen in any other
person,&mdash;a look both grave and whimsical.
&#8220;Yes, they&#8217;re only beetles. See, though:
they scoot here and there, but always head
upstream. They can&#8217;t have any reason to,
and it&#8217;s so much easier going down. And
still they&#8217;re stubborn, and fight along. I
wonder&mdash;I think they must have an Idea.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a funny girl!&#8221; he laughed. Yet
as he watched, the darting insects began to
appear not wholly insensate.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now the fish down there,&#8221; she continued,
as though to herself, &#8220;they nose about their
business. And the day-flies&mdash;with them it&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
all dancing,&mdash;just eat, drink, and be merry.
But the river-drivers&mdash;see that one, floating
on the blade of grass, all tired out; and
there he goes again, up and up, and all the
time carried below. They&#8217;re like&mdash;like
people. They&#8217;re betwixt and between, like
us. And it may be no use. But they must.
Their Idea. And the stream flows down and
down, and sweeps everything&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Her words were quiet as the brook beyond.</p>

<p>&#8220;A parable,&#8221; said Miles.</p>

<p>His voice rose no higher; for both were
suddenly a little awed, as though their spirits
had caught some rushing echo of that broader
flood, the irrevocable and universal. And
now some influence as wide, something
neither gradual nor swift, closed about them
powerfully. They had leaned forward, shoulder
to shoulder, over the brown pool; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
at this mystical, blind accession, each felt
the other tremble and draw back.</p>

<p>A kingfisher chattered angrily, away in
the upper reaches. It was the recurring
silence, however, that alarmed. Of all their
silences, this seemed as it were the end, the
turning, and the explication. But still it
endured, throbbing with a perilous energy.</p>

<p>Slowly, in a kind of sleep-waking effort,
the girl got upon her feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come,&#8221; she said. Her face, in the alder
shadows, was very pale. A shiver of light
from the brook played golden about her
throat, like the reflected glow of buttercups in
the children&#8217;s game.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come,&#8221; she repeated. &#8220;We can&#8217;t&mdash;we
must get home.&#8221;</p>

<p>Moved by the helplessness of that command,
he followed. They crossed the sunset<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
pastures almost without word or look, like
pilgrims crossing the Debatable Ground.
And when they had climbed the last hill, and
come racing steeply down toward the river
and the house, she went straight to the shelter
of Ella&#8217;s kitchen.</p>

<p>He did not see her alone again till that
evening. Meanwhile he had walked the shore,
raging at himself for what had passed, put
almost beside his reason at thought of what
might come. After blindness, it was an aching
sight that disclosed how their friendship&mdash;so
wholesome, firm, and precious&mdash;could
change at a breath, and in the most tranquil
moment of security could totter above unknown
deeps. Was he then worse than Tony,
and their house no better than the drunkard&#8217;s?
This girl had fled to him; she had
taken his promises, was here upon his honor;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
and now, because he had willfully drifted
down a pleasant way, they had reached such
a pass that&mdash;He closed the thought with a
groan. By some detestable trick, he foresaw,
their very speech could no longer be free and
honest.</p>

<p>She made no offer, that evening, to go
down with him to the lamps; and he was
rather glad of the fact than sorry at its cause.
To walk alone from tower to tower, through
the cool firs and cedars, proved a respite.
Yet when he faced the hill to return, trepidation
seized him afresh. He climbed toward
the house, vexed and wondering; and
for the second time in all his memory, was
afraid to enter.</p>

<p>She sat behind the candle-flame, a great
book flattened wide on the table, and her
head bent over it as for dear life. All the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
brightness in the room had gathered in this
corner, and at first he dared not go near.
But it was now or never with his play-acting;
and so, choosing a book at random, he sat
down opposite her resolutely, to begin the
pretense that all things remained as before.</p>

<p>Ella had gone to bed with the birds. Except
the two readers, all the world might have
been asleep. Their breathing, and the tick
of a death watch in the wall, made the only
sounds in house or valley. For all the window
stood open, the little blade of light between
them reared without wavering. This silence
at full stretch, this preposterous calmness at
close range, were alike unreal and unbearable.
His book appeared to be &#8220;The Polar
and Tropical Worlds,&#8221; a treasury of boyhood;
but the pictures swam in a blur&mdash;icebergs,
gorillas, the open coffin on Spitzbergen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
the march of land-crabs through a
palm-grove, all an empty jumble. Sometimes
his eyesight escaped the page; but then
perhaps he found her looking up, by the same
chance; caught for an instant, as her eyes
dropped, the last of a pitiful, appealing
light; and plunged into his book again,
like a desperate man hunting a text of
divination.</p>

<p>He might thus have turned a hundred
pages, and she none at all, when the contest
ended. There came a stir, a little broken
sound, abrupt and choking, which tugged at
his heart more than words.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; she sobbed, &#8220;where can I go next?&#8221;
and dropped head upon arms, across the open
volume.</p>

<p>As though a musket were shot off in the
room, his chair had struck the floor. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
circled the table and caught her up, in a gust
that sent the candle-light reeling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, what a wretched girl!&#8221; she cried,
her voice stifled in his jacket.</p>

<p>All the inevitable drift of their summer,
the whole multitude of their hidden motives,
shone clear before and about them,&mdash;a
wide, manifold peace in the tumult, like a
field of daisies seen by lightning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> birds, after a dawning chorus of vehement,
almost theatric joy, made their first
short flights from cover to cover among the
elms. The rim of eastern hills had grown incandescent,
till like a coal of fire snapping a
tight cord, the sun burned through the horizon,
and drove thin vapors slowly across
the river. They rolled back, parting for a
phantom Exodus. The breath of the sea
mingled sharply with cool fresh-water smells
alongshore, and in the fields with the fairy
spice of dying strawberry leaves. It was that
bright weather which comes once in a man&#8217;s
life; and Miles, his boots soaked in dew,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
spattered to the knee with white and yellow
petals, came wading home through tall grass.</p>

<p>Ella was rattling about her stove, alone in
the kitchen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t track that gurry in here,&#8221; she commanded,
glancing sourly.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the odds,&#8221; he laughed, &#8220;a morning
like this? It&#8217;s all clean.&#8221;</p>

<p>She turned on him sharply, but in the same
instant checking her reply, gave him a suspicious,
discountenancing stare.</p>

<p>&#8220;Leapin&#8217; the fields, hey?&#8221; She slammed
the iron door with something like a grunt.</p>

<p>Miles sat down on the doorstep, as if to
clean his boots, but in reality to give his
thoughts a breathing-space, survey the new
kingdoms which they had coursed, and take
the height and depth of their discovery. Not
over the hills, or past the dazzling limit of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
the bay, but here in these four walls lived his
happiness. The old plans, long disregarded
and summer-fallow, now lay entirely barren.
He had meant to go away, to run about in the
world, and for no purpose, except to seek
in new combinations what he might all the
time have left buried here. Here in this house
the past grief, the present transport, alike
had found their man. And what greed could
harry more out of life? Nowhere else, here;
in wonder he turned to look indoors upon
that homely and amazing theatre.</p>

<p>Instead, he saw Ella standing over him in
the doorway. The strangeness of her look
at once laid hold of him; for the round,
freckled face was no longer whimsical, but
sad, earnest, even a little pale.</p>

<p>She was the first to speak.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you be mad,&#8221; she began. &#8220;Don&#8217;t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
be mad with me, will ye, for what I&#8217;m goin&#8217;
to say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Ella,&#8221; he laughed, &#8220;of course not.
What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lots.&#8221; She nodded, grave and threatening.
&#8220;Lots the matter. I be&#8217;n a foolish,
cross-eyed old woman: that&#8217;s the first.
Set up for a smart contriver, and &#8217;ain&#8217;t the
brains o&#8217; Larrabee&#8217;s calf. Oh, meddlin&#8217; with
people! It&#8217;s dangerous, I tell ye, Miles, it&#8217;s
dangerous! Ye mean well, all along, and stir
things round so clever (ye think), and then
some mornin&#8217; wake up to see you&#8217;ve upsot
all&mdash;hurrah&#8217;s nest, everything on top, an&#8217;
nothin&#8217; to hand!&#8221;</p>

<p>She made a clumsy, derisive gesture, and
spoke on, hurriedly, a tinge of red rising in
her cheeks.</p>

<p>&#8220;Funny I&#8217;d use that sailor-talk I learnt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
from him. But there! Might&#8217;s well say it:
he was in my mind.&#8221; She looked away from
Miles, and down upon the river, where the
topsails of a schooner, slate gray, glided
above the fir-points. &#8220;When ain&#8217;t he there?
Though I guess you never heard me talk o&#8217;
him before. Ben Constantine, that was&mdash;Seems
no more&#8217;n last week I see his tops&#8217;ls
go down same as hers now. And I never&mdash;I
ain&#8217;t ever spoke of it sence. That&#8217;s how I
know. And that&#8217;s how I say it&#8217;s dangerous.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her eyes returned to him wearily, and yet
with such depth and fire as he had not known
they could contain.</p>

<p>&#8220;What did I promise?&#8221; she cried, in reproach.
&#8220;What else did I promise your
gran&#8217;father, that last day, but jest to take his
place and see you steered the course? And
look at me, how I let all slide, so long&mdash;because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
you and me and Anna has lived
happy here! &#8217;Tain&#8217;t a world to be happy in,
but to git ahead. And the Lord forgive me
for sayin&#8217; that, if it should be a lie!&#8221;</p>

<p>He could only stare at her, astounded by
this flame from ashes, this grief, perplexity,
and passionate conviction.</p>

<p>&#8220;So you must go. When I see that light
to your eyes this mornin&#8217;, and on your face&mdash;Oh,
I know it still, these many years&mdash;Come,
go, before she &#8217;pears to be somethin&#8217;
dropped down out the skies right beside ye!
But anyhow, &#8217;fore that poor child thinks the
same o&#8217; you. If ye don&#8217;t, what&#8217;s ahead for
her? Oh, it takes me to know what!&#8221;</p>

<p>Miles held up a restraining hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Too late, Ella,&#8221; he declared soberly.
&#8220;She seems that already, and&mdash;I told her.&#8221;</p>

<p>The woman dropped her arms as in defeat.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>&#8220;Be good to us all!&#8221; she groaned. &#8220;It&#8217;s
my fault.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t help it,&#8221; he began weakly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Help it!&#8221; she snapped, with an instant
change of temper. &#8220;I should hope not!
Help human natur&#8217;? Who are you, to talk
that way? Gunpowder&#8217;s gunpowder: it goes
bang in the best settin&#8217;-room or out in the
street. But this time &#8217;twas my fault.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said a voice behind them, &#8220;it was
mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>They turned like conspirators taken in the
fact, and with a mixed dismay; for the girl
stood by the kitchen table, not only tranquil
as a judge, but white as a victim. Her bearing
was unchanged, her voice level; she had
never seemed more beautiful, more necessary;
and yet the very friendship in her eyes
struck him like a blow.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>&#8220;The other door was open,&#8221; she said, with
the same mortal calmness. &#8220;At first I didn&#8217;t
know you meant me. It&#8217;s my fault, Ella. But
it&#8217;s easy to set right. I&#8217;ll go this morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>They both cried out against her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go! Hark the nonsense!&#8221; Ella tried
cheerfully to bluster. &#8220;We was jest talkin&#8217;!
Go where?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t matter where,&#8221; she answered
steadily. &#8220;The main thing is to go. I did
wrong to stay at all, but&mdash;I didn&#8217;t understand.&#8221;</p>

<p>With a face as pale as her own, Miles stood
grasping the door frame. He had been raised
above the world, to see the lighted prospect
of felicity; and now his pinnacle was knocked
from under.</p>

<p>&#8220;Anna,&#8221; he ventured, moving heavily
across the threshold. &#8220;Anna, don&#8217;t&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t understand.&#8221; Her lips trembled
slightly, but she met him still with that intolerable
friendliness. &#8220;The less we say now,
the&mdash;the better every way.&#8221;</p>

<p>All three stood at a loss, without speaking.
There seemed no outlet to their distress. The
fire fluttering in the stove mocked them with
small, pleasant, household sounds.</p>

<p>Other sounds went unheeded. They heard
a runner come pounding down the hill, saw
him flash past the window, and might never
have turned to look, had he not bounded in
headlong at the door. Tony, his black hair
tousled as by a gale, his face fire-red and
shining with sweat, caught breath enough to
laugh. The brown butt of a pistol stuck out
from the flap of his shirt.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miles, old mate, I need you!&#8221; he panted.
They had not met since the quarrel, yet here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
he stood, catching up their old relation as
handily as though he had but stepped outdoors
a moment ago. &#8220;Run up to Alward&#8217;s
and fetch the boat, will you? I&#8217;m in a
mess.&#8221; Catching sight of the two women, he
nodded cheerfully. &#8220;Hallo! No time for
shore manners. I&#8217;m in a mess. Come outside
a jiffy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miles followed him into the sunlight.
Below the step Tony turned his back
upon the door, and spoke in a rapid undertone.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must get across that river. Savee?&#8221;
His breath still came hard, his face shone
bright, like that of a man inspired by danger;
and he watched the hill above, with little
side glances, cool and shrewd. &#8220;Abe&#8217;s done
it this time&mdash;killed a man. On the spree.
Poor ass named Furfey. Finish!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>In the same breath his indifference vanished.
He looked Miles square in the eye,
full force.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve had our ins and outs,&#8221; he urged,
&#8220;but you can&#8217;t think I&#8217;m up to that, now!
Can you?&#8221;</p>

<p>It was impossible to deny the man&#8217;s earnestness.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, then,&#8221; he cried heartily. &#8220;If
you believe me, I don&#8217;t care! But <i>they</i>
won&#8217;t! That teamster found it, and Abe&#8217;s
got away clear. Half Kilmarnock&#8217;s hanging
about Alward&#8217;s; other half out chasing me,
pitchfork and blunderbuss. Get the boat,
will you? I doubled and slipped &#8217;em, up there
in the woods&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>In the act of nodding toward the hill, he
paused and listened.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, did I, though?&#8221; he drawled satirically;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
then laughing like a schoolboy, he
shook his fist at the landscape, whirled about,
and darted into the house.</p>

<p>A squad of men bobbed into sight above
the crest, and came running heavily down.
The first was Old-Hab; the last&mdash;fat, cautious,
and far behind&mdash;was Quinn the postmaster.
They swarmed about Miles at the
door, all seven or eight, like men who had
their fill of running; but their eyes were
sharpened, their tongues loosed, with the
excitement of a lifetime; and their firearms,
though of a quaint variety, were solid and
efficacious.</p>

<p>Of the many questions, Old-Hab&#8217;s rose
loudest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s the murd&#8217;rer?&#8221; he shouted,
grounding a &#8220;Zulu&#8221; fowling-piece. &#8220;Which
way&#8217;d he run, Mile?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>&#8220;What murderer?&#8221; said Miles, giving
Tony all benefits.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; began Habakkuk, &#8220;the black man
with the teeth&mdash;this Ital&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>But his followers sent up a roar.</p>

<p>&#8220;There he goes! There he goes!&#8221;</p>

<p>The whole posse swept on down the hill.
Below, halfway to the evergreens, Tony was
racing in full view. He cleared the rough
hillside in flying bounds, nimble as a goat.
By slipping through the house he had gained
such a screen for his start, that now, with
fifty yards to spare, he dove headfirst into
the cedars, and disappeared.</p>

<p>Habakkuk&#8217;s men plunged after&mdash;Miles
among the foremost&mdash;and, lashing each other
with springy branches as they fought through,
swung up river along the shore. The sailor
thundered across the gully bridge, clattered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
over the quarter-deck, and passed at once
out of earshot. Running their hardest, they
caught neither sight nor sound. Then suddenly,
from the shore below, a man hallooed.
The roar of a gun shattered the early morning
stillness, echoed along rocks and river.
Miles and the others breasted the lower
bushes on the headland, in time to see, against
the white side of the stunted obelisk ahead,
a flying figure spring up, wrench open the
door, slip through, and slam it shut.</p>

<p>Round the next bend they nearly fell over
a man stooping in the path. He rose&mdash;a
young giant with a shock of sun-bleached
hair, who grinned foolishly at Habakkuk.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nigh winged &#8217;im, pa,&#8221; he chuckled.
&#8220;Thought I hed, but don&#8217;t see no blood.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ye brimston&#8217; w&#8217;elp!&#8221; cried his father
bitterly. &#8220;Who wants to see any?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>&#8220;W&#8217;elp, hey?&#8221; retorted Lazy-Hab, serene
as an ox. &#8220;Who else was a-watchin&#8217; the shore?
He woulden&#8217; &#8217;a&#8217; run inland. Stood to reason.&#8221;
He blew the smoke from his gun-barrel,
and added proudly: &#8220;All is, &#8217;twas me doubled
&#8217;im. We got &#8217;im now, tighter &#8217;n pitch.&#8221;</p>

<p>As they drew near, no sound came from
the little tower. The sailor had gained, at
least, the high advantage of being neither
heard nor seen. Halting, the men waited in
uneasy silence,&mdash;so uneasy, that they began
to scatter behind firs and boulders. Old-Hab
stood in the open, negligently, but with a
face more weazened than ever.</p>

<p>&#8220;Inside there!&#8221; he called, in a doubtful
tone. &#8220;The&#8217; &#8217;s been fogo enough, fer one
mornin&#8217;. Master fogo. Better come out and
make it no worse. We don&#8217;t hanker fer no
more shootin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>&#8220;More you&#8217;ll get, if you try to rush me.&#8221;
Tony&#8217;s voice rang hollow within the walls.
&#8220;I&#8217;m better at it, too, than that young
red-headed savage, there.&#8221; He paused. &#8220;I
tell you. There&#8217;s just one way out o&#8217; this
nonsense. Send Miles Bissant in here. I can
trust him. We&#8217;ll splice things up. Fair play,
now, and flag o&#8217; truce, mind you! Him alone,
or I&#8217;ll&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s fair,&#8221; said Miles, and stepped
forward.</p>

<p>Old-Hab clutched his arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a trick!&#8221; he whispered. &#8220;Don&#8217;t ye
go, Mile. It&#8217;s a trick! He might&mdash;ye may
git hurt&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Somebody may, anyhow,&#8221; Miles answered,
pulling free. &#8220;Keep your men back.&#8221;
He walked to the foot of the lighthouse, and
called, &#8220;Here you are, Tony.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>The door swung barely enough to let him
squeeze through, and slammed at once. In
the gloom, he heard the lock click, and Tony
laugh quietly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lucky I forgot to give up my key! Got
yours with you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Miles fumbled in his pockets. &#8220;No,&#8221; he
answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good boy! Great!&#8221; The sailor swore
joyfully under his breath. &#8220;They haven&#8217;t
caught me yet! Come topside where I can see
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>They climbed the stairs, and, blinking at
the sudden daylight glare in the lamp-room,
sat face to face on opposite edges of the trap-door.
Tony laid his pistol at his thigh, leaned
back against a coil of rope, and swung his
feet comfortably in the lower darkness.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s bad pidgin,&#8221; he said, frowning. &#8220;Bad.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
Only some revenue skunk, but then! What
business has a dead man to look so beastly
respectable, all at once? Damn it!&#8221; Heaving
his shoulders, he laughed scornfully.
&#8220;Abe was getting ready to sell me out.
The price, I fancy, was where they disagreed.&#8221;</p>

<p>He spat down the stairway, in disgust.</p>

<p>&#8220;Funny,&#8221; he continued after a pause;
&#8220;you&#8217;re the only person <i>would</i> believe me.
It&#8217;s just Abe&#8217;s word against mine, and he&#8217;s
got clear. If they catch me&mdash;Humph!
Finish!&#8221; He patted the coil of rope, and
dropped head on shoulder, in a shocking
pantomime. &#8220;But you&#8217;re the one I expected
to founder on, not Abe. Ever since you
sighted old Quong that night&mdash;you remember?
The Chinaman: he bought for me.
And yet here you sit, the one man to believe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
me!&#8221;&mdash;He leaned across, clapped Miles
on the shoulder, and shook him gently. His
face lighted, very grave and simple. &#8220;Lied
to you so much, I don&#8217;t&mdash;Anyhow, God
bless you, old Sober-sides!&#8221;</p>

<p>He leaned back again, laughed as though
ashamed, and swung his feet vigorously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Opium was our game,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Tidy
consignment stowed across the river. If I
could once get over, and see Graves, the rest
is all greased ways. I&#8217;d have made it, too,
but that young red-head&#8221; (he raised a tattered
shirt-sleeve) &#8220;nearly blew my arm off.
We&#8217;ve seen enough of that. But we&#8217;ll see
worse, unless you do what I ask you. They&#8217;re
fools, but no cowards; that&#8217;s what I figure
on&mdash;Just one way; do it, and all&#8217;s right and
tight, every man Jack, safe and sound. Will
you?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; said Miles. &#8220;I came up
here to make terms.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So you did,&#8221; laughed Florio. &#8220;And
here&#8217;s mine. You slip down, quiet as you
can; unlock the door, quiet as you can;
leave the key in the lock, and wait on the
stairs till I signal you to come topside again.
I promise not to lay a finger on one of &#8217;em.
Solemn!&#8221; Seeing Miles hesitate, he scrambled
to his feet briskly. &#8220;Take or leave it,
that&#8217;s my ultimatum. They&#8217;ve got me in a
clove hitch. Lies with you, now, to fetch us
all out alive.&#8221;</p>

<p>Slowly, far from satisfied, Miles swung
down through the floor. He had already
sunk into the darkness, when Tony
called,&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Steady a bit.&#8221;</p>

<p>He saw the man&#8217;s head and shoulder,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
sharp in the lighted square above; saw a
great arm thrust down; and felt his own hand
gripped with a surprising warmth.</p>

<p>&#8220;About that girl,&#8221; growled Tony. &#8220;I hope
you know that she&#8217;s a wonder. You made
me damned mad, because&mdash;Well, I&#8217;m getting
old, maybe. I really did&mdash;She did fetch
me. You that&#8217;s young! Tell her that, some
day.&#8221;</p>

<p>He let go, and drew back out of sight.
Miles, in astonishment, groped his way down
to the door. A few light, scurrying sounds
came from above; the turning key squeaked
faintly; then all the hollow shaft was filled
with silence.</p>

<p>He saw neither purpose nor sense in their
agreement, which, the longer he waited, the
less he liked. Tony&#8217;s afterthought, moreover,
stuck oddly in his memory, like words<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
at parting. He had begun to wonder what
signal the sailor would give, when, sudden
and deafening in that confinement, a pistol-shot
rang overhead.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI<br />

<small>THE RISK</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">He</span> took the stairs at a bound, stumbling
in the dark. Below, while he mounted, an
uproar broke out. &#8220;Come ahead! No! I
told ye! Wait, hol&#8217; on! What, leave him?
Stave &#8217;er in!&#8221; Through it sounded another
voice, clear as the ring of good metal in
a brawl. &#8220;Afraid!&#8221; It was Anna, crying indignantly,
&#8220;And you sent him! Grown men,
afraid? Then I will without you!&#8221;</p>

<p>Next moment&mdash;catching his breath like
a diver, at thought of what he was about to
see&mdash;he surged up through the bright
square. He met an equal shock of relief and
bewilderment. A pair of boots lay on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
floor; white layers of smoke drew thinly past
the gleaming brass-work of the lamp; but
except for these and the smell of gunpowder,
the room was empty. The sailor&mdash;it seemed
at first glance&mdash;had vanished like a goblin.
But though the stair shook with hurried
trampling, Miles heard above it a sharp,
jerky, sawing noise, cut short just as a bight
of rope, rasping double round a beam, uncoiled
and flew single out at the open window.
Tony was gone, then, in no flash of
fire; but why had he shot off his pistol?</p>

<p>Before Miles could find the answer, a
scuffle rose at the stair-head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Leave go! Let me go!&#8221; cried Anna
furiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, ye don&#8217;t! Me first!&#8221; And Old-Hab
swarmed up through the opening.
Whatever he expected to encounter, his face<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
was white with anything but fear. &#8220;You!&#8221;
he exclaimed, lowering his gun. &#8220;You!
Where&#8217;s&mdash;Thank God, &#8217;t any rate!&#8221;</p>

<p>Behind him the girl&#8217;s head rose, gleaming
first in the sun, then&mdash;as she found Miles&mdash;with
an inward and more vital splendor.
They did not speak, or need to; for in one
bright instant of surprise each saw the other
restored and exalted.</p>

<p>Behind her, in turn, came huddling upward
the faces of the men, some red, some
pale, but all wide-eyed, gaping, and contorted,
like faces of hunters at the mouth
of a lair.</p>

<p>&#8220;What in&mdash;Where&#8217;s he gone?&#8221; they
shouted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Got away,&#8221; called Miles. &#8220;Down a rope,
and pulled it after!&#8221;</p>

<p>The crowding heads ducked in a single<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
impulse, the fury of the chase. &#8220;Down ag&#8217;in,
boys! Out from under, there! Git along!&#8221;
roared the voices; and below them, a seafaring
bass, bawling in the deaf ears of
Lazy-Hab, &#8220;Slid down a rope! Ketch him
yit!&#8221;</p>

<p>Slow and inquisitive, the teamster moved
toward the window, leaned in the open section,
and then suddenly turned, with a grin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look a-here, Mile,&#8221; he said, pointing a
stubby finger.</p>

<p>Far below, the sailor was racing straight
down the beach. His red stockings twinkled
as he leaped the rocks, scurried over the wet
sand, and, running out knee-deep, fell forward
with a great splash. His arm flailed
the water in desperate over-hand strokes;
his head became the black point in a widening
arrow-head of ripples.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>&#8220;Let &#8217;im go,&#8221; said Old-Hab stolidly. &#8220;We
done our part. Good riddance, bad rubbage.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Miles had turned.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll fire at him,&#8221; he said, and clattered
down the stairs. Shouts and curses
rose to meet him, and outrageous blows set
the tower resounding like a drum. Penned
at the foot of the stairway, the men were
battering the door with boot and gun-butt.
And then for the first time, Miles, half laughing,
half indignant, saw how the sailor had
used him for the trick. These honest mad-caps
had rushed in to his rescue; and fairly
on the heels of the hindmost, Tony had
reached in, stolen out the key, and locked the
door.</p>

<p>For a long time it held solidly, while they
clamored and pounded. Forming a little
phalanx, all hands, they flung at it together;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
again and again it held, and they fell back,
rubbing sore shoulders; till at last hinge or
casing crashed, splinters flew, and the captives
tumbled through into the sunshine,
with an impetus that sent Lazy-Hab rolling
on the grass.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll see!&#8221; he cried ferociously, and,
bouncing up, ran round the base of the
tower.</p>

<p>The others streamed after. On a bare
ledge of pink granite, all stood at fault, scanning
the empty shore. Then Lazy-Hab, with
a short, harsh sound of merriment, pointed
calmly. Out in a steel-bright strip of water,
a black disc, smaller than the tip of a buoy,
bobbed with living regularity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Long shot,&#8221; he chuckled, &#8220;but I&#8217;ve hit
the kag on the beacon, furder.&#8221;</p>

<p>He had swung up his gun, when Miles,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
breaking through the group, wrenched it
from his hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wha&#8217; d&#8217; ye mean?&#8221; bellowed the marksman,
raging. &#8220;You let a foreign murd&#8217;rer&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s enough!&#8221; ordered Miles coldly.
&#8220;You came near being a home-made one.&#8221;
He turned on the men, sharp and bitter.
&#8220;You fellows come to!&#8221; he said, and speaking
on, with a few domineering words found
himself their master.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; growled one. &#8220;Talkin&#8217;
sense, Mr. Bissant,&#8221; another nodded; &#8220;told
&#8217;em that, myself.&#8221; Old Quinn, with a sheepish,
absent grin of innocence, smuggled the
cartridge from his gun. Their little tumult
was over, save in fireside history. And
Miles had known his first moment of command.</p>

<p>As he turned, however, his thoughts were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
of something quite different and distant.
He saw that black dot move down aslant the
shining channel, lose all apparent energy in
the distance, and, dead as a bit of driftwood,
float past the foot of the island. But in imagination,
clearer than a spyglass, he pictured
Tony swimming on, the sharp catch of his
breath, the labor of his great muscles against
the tide, and wondered, as the dark mote
lessened on the water, what thoughts it might
confine. Only plans, perhaps, for his own
unruly future; the sailor, consistent to the
last, had played upon them all; now he would
but change the scene and the persons. And
still&mdash;&#8220;If things had been different,&#8221; thought
Miles, &#8220;if we&#8217;d started in together, somehow&mdash;&#8221;
The head drifted out of the paler
surfaces, blurred into the dark, jagged margin
of the further shore, entered the inverted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
evergreen forest, and, crossing the white
streak where a birch trunk gleamed on the
mirror, was lost in safety. And with it,
Miles felt some piece of his old self departing.</p>

<p>When he turned away, at last, he found the
men dispersing along the shore toward Alward&#8217;s,
and saw, through a gap in the firs,
Anna and the teamster climbing the distant
field slowly, with now and then a pause or
gesture, like people in earnest talk. He was
hardly at the foot of the hill, when they had
reached the house and gone indoors. He
followed, wondering why they had not waited.
From between the hackmatacks he could hear
three voices contending, then two, and as his
foot grated on the doorstep, none. In the
kitchen Ella and the teamster met him with
a guilty silence, while overhead a light step<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
came and went, and as if with a lighter
spirit, the girl hummed little intervals of
song. When these sounds returned downstairs,
Ella faced about with an air that
was almost gay.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; she cried, &#8220;for breakfast!&#8221;</p>

<p>All four sat down by the sunny window.
From the outset, Miles found the meal bewildering.
Plainly his companions had shared
some secret. They glanced and laughed inconsequently;
they talked of Tony and the
escape, with a curious exhilaration, and more
curious gaps of silence; they gave to this
meagre breakfast a sense of banqueting, but
banqueting under the edge of some unusual
event, soon to fall. The girl&#8217;s eyes, her every
word and movement, were as lamps and
music to a feast. And Habakkuk, dipping
and swerving his weather-vane countenance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
was flushed with her praises like a minstrel.</p>

<p>&#8220;All the rest scairt, and she run slap into
the lighthouse!&#8221; he was repeating, when she
cut him short.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on,&#8221; she laughed, and, rising, ended
their brief revel. They trooped after her to
the kitchen, where she caught up a bundle
from the floor. Hab wrested it from her arms,
with the bow and flourish of a country dancer,
and still laughing as in a game, she turned
to Ella, and held out both hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-by,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t say it!&#8221; rebelled the other violently,
but next instant had clasped her in
a bear-like hug. &#8220;Oh, my old precious,
good-by! Yes, you&#8217;re right, you&#8217;re right!&#8221;</p>

<p>The pair, still embracing, moved clumsily
out through the doorway. Then Ella released<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
her, crying between laughter and
distress,&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;ll be back!&#8221; She wrung the girl&#8217;s
hand. &#8220;You&#8217;ll come back like old Douglas,
time they give him the gold cane and the
speech&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>But the joke failed her, and the good creature
fled into the house. Habakkuk, with his
burden, was already climbing the slope.
Anna beckoned to Miles, who followed her in
bleak amazement, as if all his friends had
turned to strangers, and all their doings to
some alien by-play. Side by side, the two
began the sharp ascent.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s all this, Anna?&#8221; he said reproachfully.
&#8220;What does it mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>She only laughed, stretched out a hand
for help, and, falling back at arm&#8217;s length,
made him pull her by main strength, tugging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
and slipping, up the tawny hillside.
Not until he had paused for breath, high in
the wind above house and field, would she
answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;It means I understand.&#8221; She looked away
toward the sea, a strange, distant light upon
her face. &#8220;It means I&#8217;m happy. It means&mdash;well,
Tony showed the way.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miles eyed her gloomily.</p>

<p>&#8220;It means you&#8217;re going,&#8221; he said with
bitterness. &#8220;That&#8217;s all I see. Oh, Anna!
Do you think I could change over night?&#8221;</p>

<p>She faced him with steady eyes but a wavering
smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;You seem to think I can!&#8221; she retorted.
Then with that sudden elfin gravity, &#8220;When
you were in the tower,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and we
all thought&mdash;Miles, I began to see, then.
You must risk a person. It&#8217;s like the wars.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
You must risk him, to find out all you&mdash;all
he&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She paused with a little, helpless motion,
studied the ground between them, then raised
the light of her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;We three settled it before you came. An
old woman that Habakkuk knows&mdash;he&#8217;ll
take me there in his wagon. No!&#8221; she
laughed, &#8220;I won&#8217;t tell you where! But she&#8217;s
been sick, and all alone. Afterwards I may
come back to Ella&mdash;when you&#8217;re gone.&#8221;
She tossed her radiant young head in the
breeze, and the sunshine caught it like a flying
standard. &#8220;So it&#8217;s all right, and nobody&#8217;s
there to stop you any more, and you&#8217;ll become
the great man, and the lamps won&#8217;t go out,
and&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Suppose,&#8221; he broke in, &#8220;suppose I didn&#8217;t
become?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>&#8220;There it is again!&#8221; she cried in triumph.
&#8220;The war! You&#8217;ll study and work, the way
men do. Yours will be all the brave part, the
fighting and broken heads; mine&#8217;s only&mdash;the
risking. Perhaps they come back with the
trumpets and flags and everything, or blind,
on a crutch, or never at all. Do you think
I didn&#8217;t know that? Why, we&#8217;re only&mdash;we&#8217;re
all poor river-drivers in the brook
together. Go on, go out! Till you&#8217;re out and
away, I&#8217;ll never come back here in the
world!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Anna!&#8221; he cried, and could only repeat
that name, as though it were the whole revelation.
She, and she alone, had opened a great
window in his world. Never before had he
felt life to be so dangerous and inspiring, or
himself, in the vast welter, so puny and so
invincible. For him, she had cut the bonds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
of Prometheus; for herself&mdash;she stood there
unchanged, the same distant sea-light on her
face, the same wavering smile. A sacrifice to
youth had mounted here, in common words,
on a common hill of bare granite, yellow
grass, and mullein, and to his disgrace, all
the offering seemed hers, and all the wonder.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I can&#8217;t,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You must promise
when&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she answered quickly. &#8220;Let&#8217;s not
have promises. This much is ours; the rest
we can&#8217;t tell.&#8221;</p>

<p>He gave an inarticulate cry.</p>

<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t have it!&#8221; he floundered angrily.
&#8220;We can&#8217;t go, this way. I won&#8217;t let you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Miles!&#8221; She checked him, very sternly.
&#8220;What about the other time? Ella told me.
You promised something once before, not
just to him, but&mdash;all the others. You almost&mdash;Had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
you better make any more promises
yet?&#8221;</p>

<p>He felt his cheeks burn, and was unfit to
lift his eyes toward her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you see,&#8221; she went on with an
altered voice, &#8220;why we stopped right in this
place?&#8221;</p>

<p>He saw only the parched grass quivering
between them, and about their feet a silly
multitude of grasshoppers snapping upward
with thin, dry clicks, to sail in short curves
deflected by the wind. In some former silence
it had been so; but where he could not tell,
nor could he raise his head out of this present
shame. Far more visible before him lay his
broken purpose, stripped of all disguise and
easy palliation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you see why?&#8221; said Anna once more,
and when he still made no answer, suddenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
clapped her hands like a child. &#8220;I&#8217;ve made
him mad, I&#8217;ve made him mad!&#8221; she chanted.
&#8220;Now he&#8217;ll fight like a trooper!&#8221;</p>

<p>She laughed, a queer, short, hurried laugh,
and went on breathlessly.</p>

<p>&#8220;We say good-by here because it&#8217;s the
best place. And you don&#8217;t remember it!
And I do, and always did and always will,
and I told you a dreadful fib in the boat,
for the morning was just like this, and the
grasshoppers just the same, and you had the
thorn in your cheek, right exactly&mdash;there!&#8221;</p>

<p>Her volley of words was swift, her movement
swifter. The breath was still warm on
his cheek as he reached out with a cry. But
once more she was bounding up the path,
light as the wind in her hair. He heard her
laughing as she ran, plunged a few steps after,
but halted as he saw her, without a glance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
behind, overtake the plodding figure of Habakkuk.
It was ended, she was right.</p>

<p>The two moved slowly over the crest, sank
to their shoulders in the shimmering grasses
of the sky-line. For a time the black cap of
the one, the bright head of the other, went
bobbing and dwindling against the whiteness
of a cloud. Then these also blurred into
the rim, and sank. A wind&mdash;the first wind
of early autumn&mdash;followed them over the
hill, whitening the grass in little scallops and
waves, in puffs and whirls, and sudden
scurrying lines, like the breath of a colorless
flame, passing incessantly upward.</p>

<p>He stood watching, alone with the wind and
the cloud. When at last he gave over, and
wheeled about, the whole valley was darkened
and vacated. He did not see it, or the house,
or the river, for in this opposite direction lay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
only something unpalatable, necessary, with
a short name that was no less trite than wonderful.
Toward that he went downhill resolutely,
eager to begin, anxious, exulting, like
a man who has set his face toward the wars.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be

claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope

works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any

performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use

  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
